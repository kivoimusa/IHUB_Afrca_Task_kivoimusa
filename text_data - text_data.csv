2023-10-05,"As its workers strike, Kaiser Permanente strikes a deal for physicians to use an AI copilot from Nabla",Biotech & Health,"Yesterday, 75,000 workers at healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente embarked on a three-day strike to protest understaffing, burnout and low wages — setting a record for the biggest healthcare strike to date in U.S. history. But timing is everything in medicine. While Kaiser works through terms with union reps its physician division, has inked a deal with Nabla, the AI healthcare startup from Paris, to provide an AI assistant to doctors and other clinicians in its network. The aim is to reduce the amount of time they spend on admin: the AI will help with writing up notes and doing other administrative work, based on conversations that it listens to and transcribes. Nabla’s Copilot product, which was launched in March of this year, will be rolled out to physicians in the Permanente Medical Group, a part of Kaiser Permanente that covers more than 9,500 physician staff and more than 44,000 non-physician staff. It is being rolled out in Northern California initially. The service will be available to all physicians and clinicians, but using it will be optional. If the service proves to work well, the idea will be potentially to roll it out across the rest of Kaiser Permanente’s footprint in the U.S. From what we understand, Nabla and Permanente first ran a two-week pilot of the service in August of this year. The process of turning that into a commercial deal might have normally taken much longer, so it’s worth wondering if the current labor actions had a role to play in speeding that up. But to be clear, neither Nabla nor Kaiser Permanente are working on tools to take over the clinical work the doctors and others are doing. That’s not to say that others are not. Corti, another AI healthcare startup, raised $60 million in funding recently to continue building out its technology: another assistant for clinicians, but one where the aim is to help them with their patient assessments. Corti has some impressive deals in place already, too, and it says that it’s already working with more than 100 million patients/year. AI is not figuring prominently, or even at all, in the current labor action at Kaiser, but there are other industries where it has become a major point of contention. In the world of entertainment, anticipating the growing use of AI to recreate human likeness and voices, the SAG-AFTRA actors union is striking right now over the issue, specifically how AI will impact how they work and how they are compensated. The pain point that Nabla is addressing is that the admin that doctors and others are required to do after seeing patients — forms that are needed for compliance and other purposes — can take hours to get through each day. “A doctor might make as many as 4,000 mouse clicks in a 10-hour shift,” Alexandre Lebrun, the CEO and founder of Nabla, said in an interview. So most of the time, those clinicians will put off getting to it. As a result, that work stretch, and the work that’s done in that stretch, are often referred to as “pajama time,” a reference to how clinicians get to it typically at the end of the day, in their nightclothes. The burnout that results from these extra hours of work on top of work has been a persistent problem in the industry for years. Nabla’s copilot, as we have described before, essentially works as a virtual assistant. It listens to conversations and other interactions that are taking place with patients and matches up what it hears with other supplementary documents. And then it translates the resulting data into different document-based endpoints — such as prescriptions, follow-up appointment letters, consultation summaries — which typically result from those meetings. Doctors in the pilot cut out 1.5 hours of admin time using Nabla’s Copilot, the company said. Copilot initially launched based on GPT-3, the large language model built by OpenAI, which is used to generate human text and is powering hundreds of applications. Since then, Copilot has upgraded to GPT-4. But it’s also largely moved running the majority of its services now on its own LLM, although Nabla does still use GPT-4 in some areas, such as to verify the work of its own LLM. “GPT-4 is still the gold standard,” he said. “Because it’s very accurate and powerful, we use it to process feedback to correct what we do.” (Lebrun has a long and interesting background in the world of virtual assistants and natural language processing and is very much a founder to watch. His sold his first startup, VirtuOz, a “Siri for enterprise,” in 2013 to Nuance to spearhead its development of digital assistant technology for businesses. He then founded and eventually sold his next startup, Wit.ai, to Facebook, where he and his team then worked on the social network’s foray into chatbots in Messenger. He then helped establish and run FAIR, Facebook’s AI research centre in Paris, which is headed up by Yann LeCun, the Turing Award winner who is Meta’s chief scientist. LeCun is one of his advisers now at Nabla.) Nabla has raised just under $23 million from investors that include Tony Fadell, Firstminute Capital and Artemis. From what we understand, it’s also starting discussions now with investors to raise more. Updated to clarify that Nabla’s deal is with the Permanente Medical Group, part of Kaiser Permanente."
2022-11-11,Sight Tech Global 2022 agenda announced,Biotech & Health,"The third annual Sight Tech Global conference, a virtual, free and highly accessible event on December 7 and 8 convenes some of the world’s top experts working on assistive tech, especially AI, for people who are blind or visually impaired. If you don’t follow this topic, maybe you should, because a lot of cutting-edge tech over the years — think OCR and NLP — was developed at the outset with blind people in mind, and went from there to more mainstream uses. Register today! At this year’s event we have sessions with the creators of several new devices to assist with vision, and we’ll talk about the technology architecture decisions that went into balancing capability with cost and tapping existing platforms. We’ll also take our first look at accessibility in VR, which is an area of huge concern because if/when VR takes off in the entertainment and business worlds, it’s vital that people without vision have access, as they do today on smart phones and computers thanks to screenreaders like JAWS, VoiceOver and NVDA. Our third big slab of programming is about AI itself. There is no shortage of hype as far as AI’s capabilities, and it’s important to push back on that by discussing some serious limitations and deficits in the way today’s AI works for people with disabilities, not to mention humanity in general. At the same time, AI is arguably the best core tech ever for people without sight. Understanding AI is vital to the future of everyone with disabilities for all those reasons. Don’t forget to register today! And before you browse this awesome agenda: For technologists, designers and product folks working on earthshaking assistive tech, we’re hosting a small, in-person event on December 9 featuring workshops on assistive tech, many run by the same luminaries on the agenda.

David Ferrucci, Founder & CEO, Elemental Cognition Gary Marcus, Founder and Executive Chairman, Robust AI Moderator, Ned Desmond, Founder and Executive Producer, Sight Tech Global Did Computer Vision AI Just Get Worse or Better? The ability of assistive tech devices to recognize objects, faces and scenes is a type of AI called Computer Vision, which calls for building vast databases on images labeled by humans to train AI algorithms. A new technique called “one-shot learning” learns dramatically faster because the AI trains itself on images across the internet. No human supervision needed. Is that a good idea? Danna Gurari, Asst.

2023-07-12,UK femtech Daye launches virtual clinic for period pain,Biotech & Health,"U.K. women’s health Daye has a new string to its bow: It’s opened what it’s billing as the world’s first virtual period pain clinic. The new service, which extends the startup’s direct-to-consumer business selling female health products — such as its signature CBD-infused cramp-fighting tampon — is intended to support women to get a faster diagnosis of what’s causing their period pain, per founder Valentina Milanova. Women’s health startups typically share a mission to plug the gender care gap by designing and building products and services that cater to women’s needs — oftentimes picking up the slack left by traditional healthcare services which have a history of dismissing (or at least under-interrogating) issues affecting the non-male population, regardless of how much pain or how many women are suffering. In the case of period pain it’s a problem some studies suggest affects up to nine in ten women — hence Daye spotting an opportunity to further extend the support it sells. In addition to the misery of recurring pain, conditions such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), fibroids, and others associated with chronic pelvic pain can have period pain as a symptom — some of which may also affect a woman’s fertility. So there are plenty of reasons for people with periods to want to get to the root of what’s causing their painful menstrual bleeding. And Daye touts faster diagnosis of linked conditions as one of its aims for the new clinic. The period pain offering is the latest in a string of on-demand private telehealth services springing up in the U.K. (and elsewhere) to offer a faster/more convenient response to issues vs the free-at-the-point of use National Health Service (NHS) which continues to struggle to meet demand on a heavily stretched public budget. So while U.K. citizens can always go to their GP free of charge to ask for help with issues like period pain they may not easily get the kind of specialist attention that’s most likely to get to the root of the problem. Daye’s period pain clinic proves customers with either a partial or full personalized period pain management report, depending on how much they pay. They are also able to discuss the results of their report with either a nurse or a pelvic pain specialist, again depending on which of the products they buy. To scale individual assessments, Daye is using a proprietary (non-learning) algorithm — which it says is “based on national guidelines and medical research for the diagnosis and management of pelvic pain conditions” — that draws on users’ responses to a period pain questionnaire Daye sends them in order to generate their “personalized” pain management report. “We use a proprietary non-learning algorithm, which has been reviewed by and validated by clinicians,” Milanova tells TechCrunch. “The algorithm has also been tested with real-world people with confirmed diagnoses of pelvic pain conditions. The algorithm is trained on existing clinical guidelines and aims to replicate the experience a patient would receive by highly trained pelvic pain specialists.” Daye says this report may recommend pharmaceutical (i.e. drugs) and non-pharmaceutical (“holistic”) treatments (such as acupuncture or pelvic floor trainers), with the stated goal of “maximizing pain relief and patient wellbeing”. It’s worth noting that Daye’s advice actively discourages quotidian use of traditional painkillers to control period pain — given the risk of women ending up taking high doses of over-the-counter medications which it suggests can have chronic consequences on gut, kidney and liver health. So the pain management reports customers are paying for focus on changes they can make to reduce “negative side effects of over-the-counter painkillers”. Of course Daye does also sell its own alternative to popping painkillers (the aforementioned CBD tampons), so there is some potential (very direct) conflict of interest in selling a service which may recommend using its own products and discourage traditional pharmaceuticals. But on this Milanova claims its pain management recommendations are “based on clinical guidelines” — and “do not favour our own products over other interventions”. She also stipulates it tackles any conflict of interest by delegating prescription of specific pain relief measures to a separate entity, such as a pharmacy partner or doctor — who views an individual’s request and decides if CBD tampons would be suitable for them based on their medical history. Pricing The online clinic, which is only available to U.K. users for now, has tiered pricing — starting at £24.99 for what’s called the “standard” service. This provides the user with a “snapshot” of their personalized report and “primary insights” (but no consultation). (Per Milanova, this includes an assessment of their current painkiller intake, with a focus on safety. The customer also gets a preview of other sections in the full report, such as lifestyle advice and management of other symptoms. But it looks largely intended to encourage upgrading to the full report.) The remaining pricing tiers are as follows: An “advanced” version of the service which includes the customer’s full report and a 30 minute consultation with a nurse to discuss the results — at a cost of £54.99. While a “premium” version of the service, priced at £199.99, buys the customer a half hour consultation with a pelvic pain specialist to talk through the report. “Daye’s nurses are experts in sexual health and contraception with more than 15 years of experience in supporting patients with gynaecological concerns,” says Milanova, fleshing out the value proposition it’s seeking to sell women on. “They can offer a comprehensive consultation to help patients make educated choices on birth control, which is one of the main treatments for painful periods, but which can also come with significant side effects, if not selected carefully. “The nurses can also offer more detailed information about different pain-relief methods, including safe painkiller intake, acupuncture, massage, etc. Lastly, they can help create a clear roadmap for patients on strategies for addressing their symptoms and getting a diagnosis. Providing nurse consultations allows us to speed up the time to treatment, while keeping the cost for patients low.” The clinic’s pelvic pain specialists are OB-GYN doctors — who she says bring “a wealth of experience in diagnosing pelvic pain conditions and supporting patients through their fertility journey”. “Many pelvic pain conditions can also inhibit the ability to conceive naturally or carry a full-term pregnancy, which is why we partnered with reproductive health specialists who can offer support and guidance to those struggling to get pregnant,” she adds. Daye did not specify how many nurses and doctors are staffing the clinic at this stage. It’s also not employing all experts it’s working with, with Milanova noting it has “a very small full-time team” alongside a number of “trusted external partners” it can refer customer on to — including pelvic pain experts, fertility doctors, physiotherapists and nutritionists, who she says are acting as external consultants and offering consultations booked through Daye. “We will increase the availability of clinical professionals as we scale and more people access our service,” she notes. Virtual versus physical One question to mull is whether a virtual clinic can really get to the root of something as potentially tricky to pin down in cause as period pain without the customer being able to undergo physical tests or even be examined in person to confirm a diagnosis since they are sitting at home on their Internet connection, not in a doctor’s office. However Milanova suggests that the diagnosis of chronic gynaecological health conditions such as endometriosis and PCOS is “evolving towards a symptom of believing patient symptoms versus using more invasive diagnostic protocols like keyhole surgeries”. “Our clinic incorporates a clinically-validated questionnaire and symptom matcher that adhere to the guidelines of gynaecological health regulators and organisations such as NICE, ACOG, and RCOG,” she also specifies. “This ensures that conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, and other chronic pelvic pain disease are accurately assessed. “To ensure accuracy and effectiveness, our assessment tool was developed collaboratively with NHS GPs and U.K.-based chronic pelvic pain specialists. Our platform aligns with medical experts and industry best practices. Moreover, our digital assessment tool goes beyond considering symptoms and medical history alone. It takes into account a wide range of lifestyle risk factors that may contribute to period pain. By considering these additional factors, we aim to provide a more holistic evaluation that considers the unique circumstances of each individual.” It’s important to emphasize Daye’s algorithm does not automate diagnosis. Rather it’s a data processing tool that aims to speed up diagnosis in conjunction with connecting customers to vetted (human) experts in gynaecological conditions who are qualified to join the dots of symptoms and make a call on what might be going on. “Upon completion of the questionnaire, patients receive a report that includes probability scores for common conditions associated with period pain,” she explains. “It’s important to note that these scores are calculated solely based on symptoms and medical history and should not be considered a final diagnosis by themselves. A key part of our value proposition lies in connecting our patients with vetted pelvic pain specialists who can confirm the diagnosis and provide further medical advice,.” Daye intends to further extend the range of human experts it’s able to connect customers to — with an eye on other “largely unmanaged symptoms” women may suffer such as hair loss, obesity, and severe acne. So the plan looks to be to built out a wider telehealth platform focused on women’s issues and continue growing engagement across its community. “Daye’s service offers follow-on consultations with vetted specialists such as sexual health nurses, pelvic pain specialists, fertility specialists, nutritionists, and lifestyle coaches,” she notes, addng: “As our platform expands, we aim to include additional specialists like physiotherapists and dermatologists.” In another health expansion step last year the startup launched a vaginal microbiome screening service which it says it’s seeing “strong” demand for. Flush with Series A funding, Daye unwraps the big gynae health mission Teal unwraps $8.8M to build out a telehealth platform for women — starting with cervical cancer screening"
2024-05-02,Peloton to lay off 400 employees as CEO Barry McCarthy departs,Biotech & Health,"Peloton, the exercise equipment maker and online fitness course provider, said it is laying off 15% of its workforce (about 400 people) as part of cost-cutting measures. The company also said its CEO, president, and board director, Barry McCarthy, would step down after two years in the role. McCarthy, who was previously CFO at Spotify and Netflix, was coerced out of retirement in early 2022 when Peloton’s co-founder and then-CEO, John Foley, left the role alongside a major cost-cutting effort that saw 2,800 employees laid off. Foley remained as executive chair, but he left the company seven months later along with co-founder and chief legal officer, Hisao Kushi. Peloton says it’s in the process of finding a successor to McCarthy. Current Peloton chairperson, Karen Boone, and director, Chris Bruzzo, would serve as interim co-CEOs through the transition. Peloton went public in 2019 with an opening valuation of $6 billion, and saw its fortunes soar when the pandemic struck. As the world hunkered down at home, and people sought ways to stay healthy with home exercise equipment, the company’s bikes and online courses flew off the shelves, eventually earning it a market cap of $50 billion by early 2021. But when the world returned to normality, so did Peloton’s shares, and its market cap came back down to $10 billion in January 2022, a year after its peak. Today, the New York company’s market cap sits a little above $1 billion. Still, its shares went as high as 13.3% in pre-market trading on Thursday morning, seemingly buoyed by Peloton’s saying it would cut costs. Aside from reducing its headcount by 15%, Peloton said that it also intends to continue reducing its brick-and-mortar footprint in retail showrooms and will be doubling down on its international growth with a more “targeted and efficient” go-to-market strategy. All those steps are expected to help it reduce annual expenses by more than $200 million by the end of its fiscal year 2025. These announcements came just before Peloton reported worse-than-expected Q3 2024 revenue and loss, and a 21% decline in paid app subscriptions compared to a year earlier. When the company reported second-quarter results in February, its shares tumbled 24% to a then-all-time low after reporting continued revenue declines and a dismal outlook for the coming months."
2024-01-09,Smart ring maker Ultrahuman announces tracker for home ‘health’,Gadgets,"Indian wearable startup Ultrahuman is getting into the smart home game. It has announced the upcoming launch of connected hardware that’s designed to monitor the “health” of your home, as its marketing puts it. The device, which it’s calling the Ultrahuman Home, is being shown off at CES this week — with a shipping date that’s slated to start in July. RRP is US$349. Looks-wise, the Ultrahuman Home resembles a sleek (metallic) Wi-Fi router or Apple TV — basically it’s a low, squarish box — but functionality is quite different: Sensors in the device will allow the user to monitor levels of natural and artificial light, air pollution, noise, humidity and smoke in the room where it’s installed, according to the company, sending data, in the form of space “scores” and actionable insights, to a new “home” tab in the Ultrahuman app. Ultrahuman’s existing wearables are squarely targeted at the quantified self trend, linking sensing hardware to an app that crunches the user’s data to deliver personalized lifestyle advice — with the goal of helping users improve fitness and wellness. The new incoming (static) hardware is intended to supplement the ability of Ultrahuman’s smart ring to deliver personalized lifestyle nudges as it can factor in data on the indoor environment the user is exposed to too. But it can also work as a standalone in-home tracker to provide an assessment of the healthiness of a home environment — and offer advice on how to improve a sleep space, for example. Down the line, the idea is the Ultrahuman Home will be able to plug into home automation, per CEO and founder Mohit Kumar. So while it’s just an environmental tracking device on its own, installed in a smart home it could be used to power automated decisions to, for example, dynamically adjust devices like the air conditioning to promote deeper and more restorative sleep. Temperature in a bedroom can be an important factor to quality of sleep, he suggests. So the vision here is that home automation will be looped into the overarching mission of boosting users’ wellness. “In the future, you will see us integrating with protocols like IFTTT to actually get into home automation,” he says. “We’ll be able to do things like, for this individual, lowering the air conditioner by two degrees when they are in deep sleep mode. It is more beneficial because that helps them get into a slow wave or deep sleep zone. [Also for] personalised humidity levels in the room. The third is even lighting suggestions in the room.” As with diet and activity level, environments where we spend a good deal of our time can influence our health for the better or worse — depending on what we’re being exposed to. Air pollution bad, natural light good type thing. So on that level it’s not too surprising to see a wearable maker taking an interest in what’s going on in the homes of its users. Ambient factors like temperature, humidity and air quality may be impacting things like the quality of sleep a person is getting or even productivity in a workplace. But it’s fair to say Ultrahuman is blazing a bit of trail here compared to wearable competitors by expanding into environmental monitoring. The likes of Oura and Whoop — the two rivals it’s most closely tracking — have stayed in the wearable lane so far. By capturing more data-points it can link to its smart ring users, Ultrahuman may be able to improve the accuracy of its algorithms — to give its personalized advice an edge over rivals. Having another device in its portfolio to cross-sell to existing users won’t hurt either, especially as the strategy it’s taken with its smart ring also contrasts with rivals because Ultrahuman does not require users to shell out for a subscription; they just have to purchase the hardware to get ongoing access to its tracking software. The same is true with the Ultrahuman Home: There’s no subscription required for the service; just a one-off hardware purchase. Kumar says Ultrahuman’s no subscription approach has allowed it to drive sales through gifting as existing users aren’t put off from giving its products to friends or family members as a present since there’s no requirement they then have to dip into their own pocket just to use the gift. He also credits expanding offline sales of the smart ring — via retailer partners — with helping grow the user-base, given it’s the sort of device people may want to see and touch before they hand over money. Since the launch of the Ultrahuman Ring Air, its sleeker second gen smart ring which we reviewed last summer, momentum has been growing, with sales exceeding 10,000 units last month, per Kumar. “I think a lot of momentum has been built up primarily because of repeat usage — or gifting,” he tells TechCrunch. “People actually don’t like gifting subscriptions because it’s like sending a gift and expecting the other person to pay money. So that’s why I believe that we have this advantage in this category from a domestic perspective.” Returning to the Ultrahuman Home, Kumar confirms it’s designed to monitor and track changes in the environment of a particular room — so it’s intended as a static device. A large household would clearly need a couple (or more) of these devices if they want to cover the entire home. But at $349 a pop it’s likely most users will stick to monitoring just one room. And the obvious choice will be the room where they spend most of their time (bedroom, home office etc). Privacy considerations are being addressed by restricting processing of data captured by the on-board mic to the device itself, with no sound data uploaded to its servers, according to Kumar. There is also a hardware button on the device that will let users switch off the mic when they wish. The on-board wi-fi and Bluetooth can also be switched off via an airplane-mode style hardware toggle for those who want to manually limit their exposure to radio frequencies."
2023-05-24,"Meet the tiny, wireless sleep apnea diagnostic wearable headed for the US",Biotech & Health,"U.K. medtech startup Acurable has gained FDA clearance for a novel wireless diagnostic device for remote detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A formal launch into the U.S. market is slated to follow this summer. Its wearable is already being used by a number of hospitals in the U.K. (where it launched in 2021) and in the European Union, after obtaining local regulatory clearances in the region. The startup, which was founded back in 2016, is the brainchild of Imperial College professor Esther Rodriguez-Villegas, director of the university’s Wearable Technologies Lab, who spent some 1.5 decades conducting research into using acoustic sensing for tracking respiratory biomarkers to diagnose cardiorespiratory conditions — work that underpins the commercial hardware. The London-based startup raised an €11 million Series A round (~$11.8 million) back in October with its eye on the U.S. launch. Prior to that it received £1.8 million (~$2.2 million) across three different grants from Innovate U.K., a national body which supports product commercialization. Private investors in the medtech startup include Madrid-based Alma Mundi Ventures, London’s Kindred Capital and KHP Ventures, a healthcare-focused venture fund also in the U.K. which is a collaboration between two NHS Hospital Trusts (King’s College and Guy’s and St Thomas’) and King’s College London. OSA refers to a chronic respiratory condition characterized by pauses in breathing caused by the person’s upper airway being obstructed during sleep. It’s thought to affect a small percentage of adults — around 1.5 million adults in the U.K.; and some 25 million in the U.S. (with many more people affected across the world) — and while not immediately life-threatening it can be linked to serious health implications since it can contribute to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia and even heart attacks, making treatment or management important. Healthcare services often struggle to manage chronic conditions, given the expense of long term monitoring. But Rodriguez-Villegas explains that in the case of sleep apnea there is even a challenge for healthcare services to diagnose the condition — since traditional polysomnography tests are inconvenient and/or costly. (The patient is either asked to sleep overnight at a special center, where they’re fitted out with a bunch of wired sensors. Or else they are trained how to fit the various electrodes themselves at home, with the associated risk that the test will have to be repeated if sensors are incorrectly fitted or get detached during sleep.) Acurable’s tiny, self-applied wearable has been designed to offer a far more patient-friendly (and cost effective way) for diagnosis of the condition — allowing for the testing to be both remote (in patients’ homes) and super simple so patients can self-administer it. One early adopter of Acurable’s product — Dr Michael Harrison, a professor of surgery and pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital at UCSF — offers strong praise, writing in a supporting statement that the device has been “game-changing for our patients, as it is a much simpler and comfortable experience”, as well as talking up how it “enables clinicians to conduct multiple night studies at a time, improving patient outcomes by giving them a much speedier diagnosis”. For her part, Rodriguez-Villegas says she saw a role for developing technologies to solve problems with a significant social impact by addressing healthcare bottlenecks associated with chronic (and often under-diagnosed) respiratory conditions, starting with sleep apnea. So the plan is for her startup to bring more wearables to market in future, for other respiratory conditions, such as COPD and asthma — all based on the core acoustic sensing IP developed for the first device. “What I realised early on was that [chronic cardiorespiratory conditions] will not be something that could be solved if we continue with [traditional healthcare] processes — that it’s not a matter of pumping money into the system. Because there is also human resources. So you need the clinicians, the nurses, you need to understanding. So that’s where my journey started with tech,” she tells TechCrunch. “Deciding how do we create techs that can solve the bottlenecks and make patients’ lives better?” While core research underpinning the product has taken well over a decade, designing, prototyping and building the actual product took around six or seven years, according to Rodriguez-Villegas — so working on things like miniaturizing the hardware and designing a UX with high accessibility so it’s easy for patients of all ages (and tech abilities) to use which she says was a huge priority for her. “The app is designed so that there is no room for a stress or failure,” she says, explaining how she pushed her design team to avoid assuming users would know how to navigate traditional software menu structures. “I had had to have lots of conversations with my UI people in the beginning because they couldn’t understand where I was coming from.” A patient self-administering the AcuPebble with guidance from the app. Photo Credits: Acurable As for the hardware, the startup’s one-shot sensing device, which is called the AcuPebble, looks a bit like a coffee pod that’s been colored an Apple-esque shade of shiny white. So sleek and minimalist looking is it that it resembles some kind of consumer device, rather than a medical instrument, with no utility grey plastic or scary bundles of cables in sight. This purist look is entirely by design — reflecting Acurable’s overarching mission to rethink a convoluted diagnostic bottleneck using sensor-driven automation. Patients use the AcuPebble at home where it’s worn overnight stuck to the the skin of their neck (using a patented adhesive). It’s also a single-use medical device — gathering and uploading enough data across one night’s tracking of the sleeper’s breathing to produce a diagnosis. (So to borrow another piece of Apple lore, you could say it’s designed to ‘just work’.) The kit works by using tiny, high performance piezoelectric MEMS microphones to — in simple terms — listen to the patients breathing as they sleep. Although Rodriguez-Villegas is guarded with the exact details of how it works, saying the product is only partially patented so protecting IP remains a concern. Acoustic sensing as a diagnostic tool in healthcare is of course nothing new — just think of the stethoscope. But what’s novel here is the understanding of the sonic landscape associated with cardiorespiratory conditions that Acurable has been able to develop through years of research to isolate relevant biomarkers. “The hardware is designed to detect particular biomarkers we are looking for and those biomarkers are very different to the conventional ones. And how do we know this? It’s again because it’s been almost two decades in the making,” says Rodriguez-Villegas. The data the device captures is uploaded the cloud where it’s processed by Acurable whose algorithms produce an automated diagnosis which is sent to (human) clinicians for review. So much of the research which underpins the hardware was focused on understanding the specific ‘signal in the noise’ of the human body by winnowing down noisy human biology into the respiratory biomarkers of interest for diagnosing the particular cardiorespiratory conditions it’s focusing on. The algorithms it’s using for diagnosis of sleep apnea are not machine learning or any other form of artificial intelligence. Nor is its approach data driven, per Rodriguez-Villegas, who emphasizes it’s using algorithms that are “fully traceable”. Although she does not entirely rule out using AI in the future — but is categorical that AI is unnecessary for this product and, indeed, that explainability in healthcare is an essential component; that there must be no black boxes for medical diagnostics. “In this product — and the product in the market now — there is no AI. This is physiological signal processing based on very unique physiological modelling that we are experts on,” she says. “Everything in the algorithms happens for a known reason so the algorithms are fully traceable… Again, this is based on the research that we did in respiration for many years. That led us to that. It is not data driven. It’s really not data driven. I cannot really tell you exactly what it is. Because that’s part of the computational IP. “But I do understand that everybody nowadays because AI is in everybody’s mind it’s almost like that is the default thought, right, that things are AI or they are data driven. No, no. We know why every single thing is happening. So in the same way, as you might know, you know, why your heart beats and [the steps in the cardiac cycle that take place around that] this is gonna be like that.” Founder professor Esther Rodriguez-Villegas. Photo Credits: Acurable Demonstrating the efficacy of its diagnostic algorithms was a core part of obtaining regulatory clearance for AcuPebble. And details of one clinical trial of the device, which was carried out at the Royal Free NHS Trust with a sample size of 150 patients — comparing usage to at-home multi-channel polygraphy followed by sleep specialist manual signal interpretation — can be found here. Acurable says it was the first wearable medical device to obtain the CE mark in Europe for the automated testing of OSA at home. So, in its home region, it has regulatory clearance for fully automated diagnoses. But, in practice, the product has been set up so that the data (and diagnosis) are sent to a clinician — which helps keep these essential users comfortable with a novel tool — so there’s still a human in the loop. Over in the U.S. — where Acurable’s device will be officially launching at some point this summer — it’s obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA for OSA evaluation in adults for two variants of the device customised for the American healthcare market. (Rodriguez-Villegas explains it did not file for de novo clearance since there is no existing device on the market that does automated diagnosis for OSA.) The U.S. versions of the product send data to a clinician to review and provide a diagnosis. So, in that market, it’s being strictly positioned as a clinical support tool. But that’s down to differences in the regulatory environment, rather than any technical difference in capability in the different per-market versions of the product. It’s still early days for Acurable — with “tens” of hospitals using the AcuPebble at this stage. But it’s expecting usage to step up as it launches in the U.S. and predicts it will be expanding its team by around 300%. Rodriguez-Villegas also says it intends to expand into selling consumer products too “eventually” — but not before clinicians have been able to get comfortable with using the device and the data it provides. She’s dismissive of current-gen consumer wearables — which can pack a range of health-tracking claims and even offer sleep apnea detection style features, such as by tracking nighttime SPO2 — saying a lot of these consumer wearables generate data that’s “very, very misleading” and creates “enormous amount of stress” for consumers. And indeed for the doctors faced with patients bringing in their own unreliable, non-medical grade health data. “So that’s a situation that we totally want to avoid,” she adds. “Anyone can check our results. Is it is very, very good. It’s very, very reliable. But there is a lot of scepticism in the medical community when it comes to wearables. And that’s why we decided to go down [this regulated medical device] route.” Put a (smart) ring on it: Movano on why its health wearable will put women first"
2024-01-09,Got a UTI? Vivoo brings the answer to that question closer to home,Biotech & Health,"The trend we noticed at last year’s CES continues: Startups are really curious about your bodily fluids. Vivoo is no exception. The company already offers a broad range of at-home tests and launched a new test that can detect urinary tract infections (UTIs). Vivoo’s At-Home UTI Test streamlines the diagnostic process for UTIs, which affect an astonishing 150 million people globally each year. The company harnesses the power of your phone’s camera to record and analyze the color readout of the test strips. It then gives advice and context for the readings in its free app. For women, who represent 60% of UTI sufferers in the United States, Vivoo’s product may prove to be a game-changer. People often think they have a UTI but can’t be bothered to go to the doctor. Being able to test at home shortcuts the process, and the app delivers free educational content, further supporting their mission to democratize healthcare knowledge. Vivoo has a rapidly growing number of tests, and claims to have more than 200,000 users worldwide to date. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps Vivoo’s journey in transforming personal health management began with the launch of its “smart toilet” at CES last year, which received accolades for its role in early health condition detection. With a user base exceeding 200,000 and a growing portfolio of at-home tests (including wellness indicators like hydration and vitamin levels), Vivoo’s partnership with Target and its global distribution network, the company is set to make personalized health management a reality for millions worldwide."

2024-02-20,Bioptimus raises $35 million seed round to develop AI foundational model focused on biology,AI,"There’s a new generative AI startup based in Paris. But what makes Bioptimus interesting is that it plans to apply everything we’ve collectively learned about AI models over the past few years with a narrow, exclusive focus on biology. The reason it makes sense to create a startup focused exclusively on biology is that access to training data isn’t as simple in this field. While OpenAI is slowly moving away from web crawling in favor of licensing deals with content publishers, Bioptimus is facing different data challenges as it will have to deal with sensitive clinical data that isn’t publicly available at all. And just like other AI startups, Bioptimus is going to be a capital-intensive startup as it will train its models on expensive GPUs and hire talented researchers. That’s why the startup is raising a $35 million seed round led by Sofinnova Partners. Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Frst, Cathay Innovation, Headline, Hummingbird, NJF Capital, Owkin, Top Harvest Capital and Xavier Niel also participated in this funding round. Bioptimus isn’t coming out of nowhere. At the helm of the company, Jean-Philippe Vert will act as co-founder and executive chairman in a non-operational role. At his day job, he is the chief R&D officer at Owkin, the French biotech unicorn that tries to discover new drugs and improve diagnostics through AI. Rodolphe Jenatton, the CTO of Bioptimus, has more experience in artificial intelligence, as he was a senior research scientist at Google. Several co-founders are also former researchers at Google DeepMind. Image Credits: Bioptimus As part of Owkin’s work for top biopharmas, Owkin has amassed multimodal patient data through partnerships with leading academic hospitals around the world. Bioptimus will leverage this unique dataset to train its foundational model. A moonshot project from Owkin Bioptimus could even be considered as a sort of spin-off company from Owkin — or a so-called moonshot project. But why didn’t Owkin decide to work on a foundational model in house? Creating new AI models is such a daunting task that creating a separate entity made more sense. “Building biology [foundational models] is not a part of Owkin’s roadmap, but Owkin supports and is keen to partner with a company like Bioptimus. Training very large-scale [foundational models] requires important resources in terms of data volume, computing power and breadth of data modalities that are easier to unlock as a specific entity,” Vert told TechCrunch. “As a ‘pure player’ in foundational models, Bioptimus is better set up to do this.” The startup has also signed a partnership with Amazon Web Services. It sounds like the company’s model will be trained in Amazon’s data centers. Now that Bioptimus is well funded, it’s time to work on the AI model and see what the biotech research community can do with it. “Eventually, the AI we build will improve disease diagnosis, precision medicine, and will help create new biomolecules for medical or environmental use,” Vert said."
2023-10-12,Israeli biotech startup Mana.bio launches AI-fueled programmable drug therapy,Biotech & Health,"Israeli biotech startup Mana.bio has been planning to launch its programmable drug treatment solution for months, and decided to forge ahead in spite of the attacks that happened this past weekend in the country. The company is employing AI to design lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with the goal of creating programmable drug treatments. “Mana.bio’s integrated experimental and machine learning platform enables the discovery of smarter, faster, more precise delivery formulations to unlock the field of nucleic acid-based and genetic medicines,” company co-founder and CEO Yogev Debbi said in a statement. The solution involves RNA-based therapies, which have the potential to treat infectious diseases, cancers and single genetic disorders, but as Debbi explained, RNA molecules are highly volatile. “RNA molecules can’t be administered just like that to the human cells, as they fall apart. They have to be protected by a special package (or carrier) until they are inserted into the cells where they can operate,” Debbi said. Mano creates this special package. Debbi’s company not only came out of stealth this week, it also announced a $19.5 million seed investment led by Andreessen Horowitz Bio + Health, Base4 Capital, NFX, LionBird and Technion. He was also set to travel to San Diego for the first of two conferences to deliver papers on his company’s approach to drug discovery when the attack happened. The startup has been in stealth researching this approach for several years before this week’s announcement, and while faster drug discovery is something that could benefit everyone, it was not easy to decide how to proceed under the circumstances. “We started thinking what’s going to be the impact, and should we do it or not,” he said. “Just to give the context, we’re all devastated in Israel. This is the darkest time at least that I can remember [in my lifetime],” he told TechCrunch. As it turned out, all flights out of Israel were canceled shortly after the attack, so going to America and presenting the paper was no longer on the table, but he says it’s important to be launching in spite of the current challenges because it’s important work. “We stayed committed to our goals, to our partners and to patients [who could eventually benefit from this approach] because we’re working in drug development,” he said. Launching a startup is always going to be tough, especially one in an area as volatile as biotech. Doing it in the midst of a wartime situation adds an unimaginable degree of difficulty, but the company is determined to push through, even under such difficult circumstances. “It’s really, really hard, and even with all the sadness and all the bad news that you hear all day long, we as a company, we have the privilege and also the commitment to really continue pushing forward and continue business as usual,” Debbi said. “And so this for me, is a very important signal to the team, to the country and to the world.”"
2022-09-14,Cultured meat startup Prolific Machines unveils its ‘Henry Ford approach’ to cell growth,Venture,"The global cultured meat market is poised to reach half a billion dollars by 2030; however, this kind of technology is still very much in the R&D phase for a lot of companies that have emerged over the past five years. Cultured meat, also known as cultivated meat, is animal meat, but instead of slaughtering the animal to get it, cells are collected from the animal and cultivated in a lab where they are then assembled into a structure of tissue that resembles the same meat we all eat. We’ve seen a few cultured meat companies unveil their products. For example, Novel Farms has a pork loin, while Bluu Seafood, a German company developing lab-grown seafood, debuted its fish sticks and fish balls last month. Same for Dutch-based Meatable with its sausages, SCiFi Foods with its burgers, and chicken for UPSIDE Foods. However, the manufacturing process for cultured meat has historically been “both very difficult and very expensive,” Prolific Machines’ co-founder and CEO Deniz Kent told TechCrunch. That’s what his company is out to change. “You have to use these growth media proteins which are some of the most expensive things — one of the proteins we are replacing is like 30,000 times more expensive than a gram of gold,” he added. “It’s really hard to scale anything for this reason because you have to use these proteins.” Novel Farms flexes its pork loin ‘muscle’ following future equity investment Kent, who has expertise in stem cell biology, explained that these proteins have been used for decades, mainly in the biopharmaceutical industry. The technology works on pharmaceutical products that have big budgets, but not so good when you are trying to make a high-volume, low-margin product like meat, he added. While having the idea for better proteins, he met physicist Max Huisman and machine learning engineer Declan Jones and convinced them to quit their jobs and form Prolific Machines with him in 2020. That said, Prolific Machines believes it has a unique manufacturing approach for cultured meat cells and is coming out of stealth mode with $42 million in combined seed and Series A funding to build what Kent calls an “assembly line for biology.” The company aims to do for biology what Henry Ford did for automobiles at the turn of the 20th century. Its technology, still in its early stages, is a way to grow and control cells without the need for any of those expensive recombinant proteins for cell production, he said. Prolific Machines will bring products to market, but will also license its infrastructure to other cultured meat companies. “Back then, nobody really owned cars apart from super-rich people. What really changed things was Ford,” Kent said. “They built the assembly line for cars and found a way to manufacture cars at a price that normal people could afford. That transformed the industry because then you went from hundreds of car companies to only three companies having over 70% of the market.” He believes the same thing is going to happen in the cultured meat industry: There are hundreds of companies right now, but “most of them will die because they won’t have a way to manufacture cultured meat cheap enough. The ones that can find a way will survive,” he added. Prolific Machines was part of SOSV’s IndieBio program in 2021. SOSV led Prolific Machines’ pre-seed round. Meanwhile, for its new capital infusion, the seed-round portion was led by Arvind Gupta, partner at Mayfield, and the Series A by Bill Gates–founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “I never intended to invest in another cultured meat company, but when Deniz showed me what they were doing, I was blown away by the creativity in their approach to reinvent the assembly line for food production,” Gupta said in a written statement. “It is my goal to help reverse climate change by partnering with incredible teams, and I am convinced Prolific Machines will be a winner in the race for sustainable food production.” Joining in on the two rounds was a group of VC firms and individual investors, including David Adelman, Mark Cuban, The Kraft Family, David Rubenstein, Michael Rubin, Breyer Capital, The SALT Fund, Purple Orange Ventures, Fred Blackford, Jake Poliskin, Matt Katz and Baruch Future Ventures. Add to that a group of celebrities and restaurateurs, including Kevin Love, Tobias Harris, Meek Mill, Ciara and Russell Wilson, Emily Ratajkowski, Maverick Carter, Sean Feeney, Michael Schulson, Mark Bucher and RJ Melman. Kent said the Series A was raised a year ago, but the company is coming out of stealth now as it prepares to raise a quite hefty “$170 million-ish” Series B in the first quarter of 2023. The new funding will go toward building a 25,000-square-foot headquarters in Emeryville, California, and ramp up hiring to expand its assembly line programs, including fish, poultry and beef. Meanwhile, he expects the facility to be done in spring 2023. Plans for the company’s first product include an unstructured Wagyu, which means ground meat. Prolific Machines also has a number of high-profile chefs — none that Kent could name now — who have agreed to partner with the company and use its first cultured meat products. Is cell-cultured meat ready for prime time?"
2023-08-01,Amazon expands its virtual health clinic nationwide,Biotech & Health,"Amazon is expanding its Amazon Clinic virtual healthcare marketplace to all customers nationwide. The online retail giant announced today that customers in all 50 states and Washington, DC will be able to easily access licensed clinicians via video visits for more than 30 common health concerns, such as pink eye and urinary tract infections. Amazon Clinic launched in November 2022 as a way to connect users with healthcare providers. Amazon Clinic does not provide the healthcare services itself and instead supplies a platform to connect telemedicine partners with users. To get treatment via the service, customers need to visit Amazon Clinic on the Amazon website or Amazon mobile app. From there, customers can compare response times and prices from multiple telehealth provider groups, complete an intake form and then connect with their chosen provider. Depending on the state in which a customer is located, they can connect via messaging or video call without an appointment or insurance. Through Amazon Clinic’s secure message portal or video call, the clinician will provide a recommended treatment plan, which may include a prescription. Customers can choose to fill their medication at Amazon Pharmacy with free shipping or at any other pharmacy. “By creating a healthcare experience that is transparent and simple, we hope to make health care more accessible for all,” Dr. Nworah Ayogu, the chief medical officer and general manager at Amazon Clinic, said in a blog post. “We’re excited to bring Amazon Clinic to even more customers, and we’re working hard to make even more conditions available for treatment in the coming months.” Amazon has been trying to break into the healthcare industry for years. The online retail giant launched and then shut down a telehealth service called Amazon Care. Amazon also closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of healthcare provider OneMedical earlier this year. Plus, the company launched Amazon Pharmacy off the back of its acquisition of PillPack. In 2018, it formed a JV with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to build an employee healthcare operation, appointing a high-profile doctor to lead it. That service never appeared to take shape as expected and shut up shop in 2021. After mothballing Amazon Care, Amazon reenters tele-health with Amazon Clinic, a marketplace for third-party virtual consultants"
2023-01-20,"With a focus on patients with chronic illness, Nourish hopes to help Americans eat better",Startups,"Many of us would feel better if we ate better. But for patients with chronic diseases, the issue is more pressing: Fixing their diet is often key to keeping their condition under control. According to the CDC, six in 10 adults in the U.S. have a chronic disease such as diabetes or heart conditions. Millions of these could benefit from professional nutrition guidance but don’t always have the time or means to seek care. Enter Nourish, a U.S. startup that connects users with a registered dietitian (RD) via telehealth and helps them get their consultations covered by health insurance. Telehealth is part of the appeal, both for patients and nutritionists, but the RD qualification is an important point too. “All registered dietitians are nutritionists — but not all nutritionists are registered dietitians,” the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics warns. Unless you seek an RD or RDN (registered dietitian nutritionist), you won’t be sure that your nutritionist is properly qualified for the job — and your insurance will not cover it. Insurance coverage is a big part of Nourish’s value add. The startup’s CEO, Aidan Dewar, told TechCrunch that “94% of our patients are fully covered by insurance and pay nothing out of pocket. Most of the rest just have a small co-pay.” That’s because since 2002, medical nutrition therapy has fallen under the scope of Medicare under certain criteria, a move that led major private insurers to follow suit. On paper, qualified patients who are aware of this could get reimbursed after seeing an outpatient RD, whether online or off. But as often with healthcare in the U.S., the process is cumbersome for practitioners, and many end up not accepting insurance. In contrast, Nourish’s RDs are employed by the company, which took care of closing partnerships with Medicare and major U.S. healthcare companies Aetna, BCBS, Cigna, Humana and United Healthcare in exchange for a fee. Nourish currently employs 50 RDs, but has a waitlist of more than 400 RDs interested in joining its team, Dewar said. Having launched in November 2021, the startup is pacing itself but already reports “millions in revenue” from “thousands of patients seeing dietitians each month.” And by the end of the year, it plans to employ 200 RDs and grow its non-RD team from 18 to around 30. Nourish’s growth plans will be funded by a recent $8 million seed round that brought its total funding to $9.3 million. Led by Thrive Capital, it had participation from Susa Ventures, Operator Partners, Box Group and Y Combinator, whose accelerator the startup graduated from in 2021. Dewar also highlighted that several of Nourish’s angel investors built exciting healthcare companies, such as Alto Pharmacy (Jamie Karraker), Headway (Andrew Adams), Rightway Healthcare (Jordan Feldman) and Spring Health (April Koh). “Nutrition has largely been excluded from the healthcare system, despite its importance and connection to people’s health. We love that Nourish is changing that by bringing consumers, registered dietitians, and insurance companies together to build a more affordable and complete nutrition program,” Thrive Capital general partner Kareem Zaki said. Expanding nutrition therapy Nourish has big goals: By helping people to eat well, the startup is hoping to contribute to solving the American healthcare crisis. “More than half of Americans have a chronic condition related to what they eat, which has contributed to healthcare costs going up and quality-adjusted life expectancy going down,” its founders said. Dewar and Nourish COO Sam Perkins are childhood friends and landed on Nourish’s mission after struggling with chronic conditions themselves (migraines and irritable bowel syndrome, respectively). After experiencing the positive impact of nutritional care, they co-founded their startup together with CTO Stephanie Liu, who had become close friends with Perkins at Princeton. The founders knew firsthand that working with a dietitian was a long-term process, but this vision is also reinforced by the startup’s chief clinical officer, Adrien Paczosa. “We focus on a long-term, sustainable approach — truly a lifestyle change,” she said. “We will never put you on a fad diet that is impossible to maintain, tell you to only eat salad for every meal, make you track everything you eat, or give you some generic, one-size-fits-all meal plan.” Because of this approach, the startup doesn’t see itself as directly competing with weight loss apps. However, it plans to use its seed round to launch an app of its own by the end of the quarter, but with different goals in mind. “The mobile app will augment the core experience of seeing your dietitian, with features including high-quality nutrition content and resources, clinical outcome tracking, and features that help you acquire the food such as integrated grocery delivery (so your RD can prescribe you food in the same way an MD can prescribe medicine),” Nourish explained. The app’s goal is to make sure that patients are achieving the desired outcomes. Indeed, Nourish has two priorities in 2023: growth and outcomes. This road map has to do with how Dewar and his team define success. “It’s [both] about how many people we help and how much we help them.” There’s still plenty of room for Nourish to grow on both fronts: The vast majority of chronic illness patients who could benefit from seeing an RD currently don’t, and even when they do, eating well remains a struggle. Will an app help make their journey easier? Only time will tell."
2024-04-30,Midi is building a digital platform for an oft-overlooked area of women’s health,Biotech & Health,"When Joanna Strober was around 47, she stopped sleeping. While losing sleep is a common symptom of perimenopause, she first had to go to multiple providers, including driving 45 minutes out of San Francisco to pay $750 out of pocket, to get that diagnosis and proper treatment. “That feeling of wow, I’ve really been suffering unnecessarily for the past year really stuck with me,” Strober said on a recent episode of TechCrunch’s Found podcast. “I started talking to all my friends and trying to understand what’s going on with them and what became clear is that perimenopause and menopause is this big thing. It kind of hits women like a pile of bricks. There’s lots of different symptoms to it and there are very few providers who are trained to take care of this population.” That realization is what inspired Strober to launch Midi Health, a telehealth platform designed to serve women in midlife by connecting them with providers who are trained in perimenopause and menopause symptoms and treatments. Despite her “aha” moment, Strober explained why she couldn’t launch the startup right away. She said that Midi couldn’t have existed had the U.S. government not changed its rules surrounding telehealth and where people could access care during the pandemic. Because of the changes surrounding digital health, Strober said the company was able to launch its platform that brought care to women as opposed to women having to find in-person care. “Understanding that this problem that had been around for a long time and could finally be addressed using telehealth was a very exciting revelation,” Strober said. “And that’s why I wanted to start this company.” Midi operates a little bit differently than many of the other digital health companies started in the post-pandemic wave, Strober said. She said Midi isn’t set up to be a digital avenue for users to get one-off care or treatment as fast as possible like many other companies of the same era, but rather to be a platform where women build long-term relationships with providers that make them feel seen. This approach is also why Strober thinks Midi has been able to keep growing and raising VC funds as VCs have become less interested in the category. The company recently raised a $60 million Series B round led by Emerson Collective with participation from Google Ventures, SteelSky Ventures, and Muse Capital, among others. This round brings the company’s total funding to $99 million. Digital health startups raised $13.2 billion globally in 2023, according to CB Insights data. This marks a decrease of 48% from 2022, at $25.5 billion, and a decrease of 75% from 2021 when a record $52.7 billion was invested. “I think too few telehealth companies didn’t think about that long-term customer relationship,” Strober said. “We view ourselves as building a healthcare trusted brand. So our brand is expert care for women. We need to give you that amazing care so you come back to us over and over and over again. That is what women are doing.” Midi isn’t Strober’s first digital health startup and she talked about how her past experience building Kurbo Health, a startup focused on child obesity before digital health was even a thing, influenced her choices in building Midi. She also talked about how her past life as a venture capitalist also played a role in how she approached the business. With this latest round of funding, Midi looks forward to expanding care in areas that fall under perimenopause and menopause, including things like sexual wellness, hair and skin care and access to testosterone. “People keep on asking, you know, when are you leaving perimenopause and menopause?” Strober said. “But perimenopause and menopause is a big market. So we are working a lot on understanding what are the health needs of women during this period of their life and how do we appropriately rise to meet those concerns.”"
2023-11-15,"Inito, a startup that helps women quickly track fertility hormones at home, raises $6M",Startups,"Inito, a YC alum that helps women track fertility hormones quickly at home, has raised $6 million in Series A funding led by Fireside Ventures. The startup’s fertility monitor and kit is designed to give users easy-to-read fertility diagnostic results directly on their phone in just 10 minutes. The Bengaluru, India-based startup was founded in 2015 by CEO Aayush Rai and CTO Varun A Venkatesan, who previously worked at medtech giant Siemens. Rai worked on product development, while Venkatesan was a researcher for medical products. The duo bonded during their Sunday kayaking sessions and chatted about how they wanted to spend their lives doing something that actually impacted people’s lives. They ended up leaving their jobs to start Inito to build tools that would empower people to manage and understand their health at home. While standard at-home ovulation tests predict your fertile days by tracking estrogen and Luteinizing hormone (LH), they don’t measure the hormone that confirms your ovulation, which is progesterone metabolite PdG. Inito measures four fertility hormones: estrogen, LH, progesterone metabolite PdG and FSH on a single test strip. The kit comes with the monitor, test strips and access to the Inito app. The monitor snaps onto your smartphone and can read high-density test strips with precision. Once you sign up in the app and input your cycle history, Inito reminds you to test on certain days and provides step by step instructions. You dip the test strip in urine, snap the monitor to your phone and insert the test strip into the monitor. Image Credits: Inito With other standard tests, you get “yes/no” results, and you need to use different test strips to track fertile days and confirm ovulation. Inito provides numerical values of your fertility hormones and personalizes results to your body. It gives your full fertile window of six days and also confirms if you actually ovulate by looking at the rise in progesterone metabolite PdG. The company notes that if you have irregular cycles, actual data is necessary to know exactly when you ovulate, and when it’s the best time to try to conceive. “Unlike other products that leave the interpretation of hormone values to the user, our app looks at the evolution of four hormones together and determines if the fertility rating for that day is low, high or peak and if ovulation has indeed occurred in this cycle,” Rai told TechCrunch. “With the latest advancements in AI, we have taken this one step further by explaining why a result was given in natural language.” The Inito Fertility Monitor is registered with the FDA as a Class I medical device that is exempt from FDA’s premarket notification submission requirements. The fertility monitor starter kit costs $149 and includes the device and 15 test strips. A pack of refill strips costs $49. Both products are available on Inito and Amazon. As for the new funding, the startup plans to use it to build even more advanced analytics with the help of AI. Inito users have taken over 2.5 million tests, which Rai says gives the startup a massive data set to train its algorithms on the interplay of the four key hormones in a menstrual cycle. The startup wants to be able to allow users to correlate symptoms, moods, sleep patterns and medications to their hormones. Image Credits: Inito Inito also wants to scale its business operations. The startup’s app is currently only available on iOS, but Inito plans to use the new funding to build an Android app. In addition, Inito wants to invest in R&D for new products. “While fertility hormone testing is our first product, this funding raise will allow us to invest in R&D for new tests that cater to solving problems faced by both patients and practitioners,” Rai said. “We are building point of care tests for tracking pregnancy health, ovarian reserve and male fertility hormones. Our technology uses a combination of hardware, biotechnology and machine learning to improve the accuracy, reliability and density of test strips allowing them to measure multiple parameters on a single testing platform.” The new round brings Inito’s total funding raised to date to $15 million. The startup previously raised $9 million from Y Combinator, former Nurx CEO Varsha Rao and a dozen physicians and family offices. As for the startup’s long-term roadmap, the startup believes that every human being needs access to healthcare and data about their body. “We want to bring a variety of tests for fertility and beyond on a single device at home; empowering people with direct access to health information and fostering a better understanding of their bodies and health conditions,” Venkatesan said. “We look forward to a day where Inito will be present in every household and be as ubiquitous as a thermometer.”"
2022-12-16,"TechCrunch+ roundup: New VC rules, AI biotech investor survey, Instagram ad case study",Startups,"When a cat is scared, it may hide under the couch; a startled fish will swim into a dark hole. And when humans feel uneasy, we tell ourselves stories. An example: “growth at all costs” is a fairy tale made possible by cheap money that helped venture capitalists set expectations for founders — and each other — for years. Similarly, “everyone needs 18-24 months of runway” is a nice motto, but when it takes three times longer to raise a round than it used to, it may no longer be useful advice. “These ‘VCisms’ borne out of an era of plenty have permeated boardrooms and investor meetings everywhere,” notes Neotribes Ventures partner Rebecca Mitchem in a TechCrunch+ post this morning. Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members. Use discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription. “It’s time to ask ourselves if these VCisms are still relevant or if it’s time to change.” In a data-driven piece that looks at post-money valuations, deal sizes and dilution rates going back to 2012, Mitchem says we’re now heading into a new era where the tech industry will embrace “growth at reasonable costs.” Founders can continue to water down their ownership by pursuing fat rounds, or they can decide to grow more slowly, which will leave everyone involved with a larger stake over time. “While it may feel counterintuitive, given the recent market environment, the value of the equity for all parties — investors, founders and employees — is higher in the more conservative growth scenario,” says Mitchem.

2022-11-22,Sequoia India’s Surge backs health tech startup RedBrick AI in $4.6M funding,Biotech & Health,"Health tech startup RedBrick AI has raised $4.6 million in a funding round led by Sequoia India and Southeast Asia’s Surge as it plans to expand the market for its medical imagery annotations solution. Artificial intelligence has become ubiquitous in clinical diagnosis. But researchers need much of their initial time preparing data for training AI systems. The training process also requires hundreds of annotated medical images and thousands of hours of annotation by clinicians. The Delaware-headquartered SaaS startup, which has an Indian subsidiary in Pune, is solving that problem with its automated and semi-automated annotation tools. RedBrick AI co-founder and CEO Shivam Sharma said the startup helps make annotations up to 60% faster using its configurable workflow system that works with medical imagery such as CT scans, X-rays, MRIs and ultrasound. “We see ourselves building the foundational layer of artificial intelligence in healthcare. In the future, we want to help teams with everything from the data preparation to FDA clearance of the algorithms,” Sharma said in an interview with TechCrunch. Founded in 2021 by former SpaceX Hyperloop engineers Sharma and Derek Lukacs (who serves as CTO), RedBrick AI offers specialized annotation tools that can be accessed through a web browser and integrated within customers’ existing data storage system, such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Azure. For annotating complex 3D medical images, it also has semi-automated tools. Image Credits: Redbrick AI RedBrick AI additionally provides APIs that machine learning engineers can integrate with their cloud solutions and clinical data stores, including hospital enterprise PACS servers. “Clinicians just need to log into their browser, and the workflow aspect of it is all automated,” Sharma said. Once correctly annotated, imagery can be used for faster and more detailed diagnosis. The annotated imagery can also be used by surgical robots and to automate detection of cancers. RedBrick AI has a seven-member team that is mostly based in India, though the startup focuses primarily on the U.S. and Europe for marketing its tools. The startup also sees 99% of competition coming from open source tools, followed by the in-house ones developed by companies to address their specific requirements. The early customer base of RedBrick AI includes Germany’s biotech startup Orbem, Canada’s cancer and disease screening platform Prenuvo, Boston-based nonprofit hospital and physician network Mass General Brigham and Maharashtra’s radiology AI platform Deeptek. The all-equity seed round also saw participation from Y Combinator and angel investors. Before this round, the startup was named among Y Combinator’s Winter 2022 cohort that was dominated by 32 Indian startups. Sharma said RedBrick AI plans to utilize the fund to go beyond its current customer base and reach enterprises. It also plans to hire new engineers to expand the specialized toolset."
2023-06-20,Diabetes management startup Clivi wants to be ‘Livongo of Latin America’,Biotech & Health,"Over 422 million people around the world have diabetes, with the World Health Organization noting that the majority of those with the disease are living in low-income and middle-income countries. In Latin America, there are over 40 million adults with diabetes, according to Statista. And with the global digital health market poised to reach $1.5 trillion in the next seven years, Clivi, a Mexico-based diabetes management startup, wants to help control the disease through its comprehensive, technological and personalized approach to diabetes healthcare delivery. “In Mexico, there is an average of one endocrinologist per almost 10,000 patients,” Clivi founder and CEO Ricardo Moguel told TechCrunch. “You might see a doctor every three months, but for chronic conditions, patients need to be making decisions every day.” Clivi is making a balance between humans and technology by connecting patients with endocrinologists, nutritionists and psychologists and enabling users to access monitoring and treatment plans via their communication channel of choice (e.g., WhatsApp) so they can better achieve their treatment goals and adhere to lifestyle changes. The company also provides all of the supplies, like glucometer, test strips and blood testing kits, as well as medication. Though health plans start at MX$790 per month, the average patient will pay MX$40 per month with private insurance, Moguel said. He explained that people living with diabetes in Latin America often begin treating their disease late, which can lower their life expectancy by 10 years. Clivi’s goal is to help patients get back four of those years. Since going live in October 2021, Clivi’s platform has helped thousands of patients so far, 94% of whom have achieved diabetes control within six months, Moguel said. The company is currently seeing an average of 2,000 new patients join the platform each month. It also reached $2 million in annual recurring revenue over the past 15 months, and Moguel expects 10x that growth within the next 12 months. Over the next five years, the company intends to serve 1 million people through its digital clinic and diabetes remote monitoring service, Moguel said. Today, it announced $10 million in seed funding toward that goal. The investment was co-led by Dalus Capital and Foundation Capital, with participation from a group of investors, including Cathay Innovation via its C. Entrepreneurs fund; Femsa Ventures; Quiet Capital; 500; Next Billion Ventures; and Conexo. There was also a group of angel investors, including Jüsto founder and CEO Ricardo Weder, Kueski founder and CEO Adalberto Flores, Trust Networks co-founder Suresh Batchu, 99 and Mara founder and CEO Ariel Lambrecht, Meta executive Tara Syed and Reina Madre co-founders Vicente Aristegui and Juan Moctezuma. The new funding will be used to finish out the product, including its artificial intelligence technology, so that more of the functions are automated and doctors can increase their capacity for treating patients, Moguel said. The company is also going to expand its work with enterprises and public health organizations in Mexico. He expects to “dominate the Mexican market and become the No. 1 diabetes clinic in Mexico within the next year.” “This will help us to prepare the ground before we start expanding our solution to other Spanish-speaking territories across the region,” Moguel said. “This is the master plan to become not just the Livongo of Latin America, but the largest player in terms of diabetes and chronic conditions in the whole of Latin America.” Taking advantage of Latin America’s market downturn"
2022-11-28,Bionaut Labs gets $43.2M for its tiny drug delivery robots,AI,"Founded in 2017, Bionaut Labs arrived out of stealth in March 2021, with plans to commercialize longstanding research around drug delivery robots. The Los Angeles-based startup today followed up its initial $20 million funding announcement with a $43.2 million Series B, bringing its total raised up to — you guessed it — $63.2 million. This round was led by Khosla Ventures and featured new investors Deep Insight, OurCrowd, PSPRS, Sixty Degree Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, GISEV Family Ventures, what if ventures, Tintah Grace and Gaingels. If you’ve followed the robots space, you’re likely familiar with the research that has gone into these tiny, remote-controlled medical robots. Bionaut’s own work now has a couple of deadlines in place, including 2023 pre-clinical studies, followed by clinical trials with human patients the following year. “There has been a dearth of innovation around treatments for conditions that cause tremendous suffering, in large part because past failures have discouraged even the best of researchers,” CEO and co-founder Michael Shpigelmacher says in a release. “Bionaut Labs remains committed to finding new ways to treat these devastating diseases, which are long overdue for a breakthrough.” The startup’s magnetically driven robots of the same name are designed to deliver treatments to the midbrain — a more direct application than standard systemically delivered (intravenously, orally, etc.) drugs. The firm has its eyes on a number of extremely debilitating conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease. This round of funding, meanwhile, will be focused on treatments for malignant glioma brain tumors and Dandy-Walker Syndrome. The money will also go toward advancing R&D on its technology and hitting the aforementioned milestones. Shpigelmacher and co-founder Aviad Maizels were both previously involved with PrimeSense, the Israeli-based 3D imagining firm behind Microsoft Kinect. That firm was acquired by Apple in 2013 and ultimately served as the foundation for its Face ID tech."
2024-06-06,Eyebot raised $6M for AI-powered kiosks that provide 90-second vision exams without an on-site optometrist,Startups,"Over half of Americans wear corrective glasses or contact lenses. While there isn’t a shortage of low-cost and luxury frames available online or in stores, consumers can only buy them with a current eyeglass prescription. That means they first need a vision exam from an optometrist to receive that prescription. But due to a nationwide shortage of eye care practitioners, it may take weeks, especially in rural areas, to get an appointment. Eyebot, a new startup coming out of stealth on Thursday, wants to reduce the time it takes to receive a vision exam to about 90 seconds without the direct involvement of an optometrist. Starting in October, the Boston-based company will roll out its self-serve, vision-testing terminals in shopping centers, grocery stores and pharmacies in New England. Anyone who wants to have their vision checked can walk up to Eyebot’s five-ish-foot kiosk and press a button, and the company’s computer vision technology will automatically scan the person’s eyes, extracting the eyeglass or contact lens prescription. (While Eyebot can’t perform initial fittings of contact lenses, it can update an existing prescription.) Eyebot’s founder and CEO Matthias Hofmann said he developed similar technology 10 years ago at EyeNetra, a startup that used smartphones to test eyesight. EyeNetra went out of business several years ago, according to Hofmann, who worked there as the leading engineer until 2015. “We realized that using smartphones is not actually the solution,” said Hofmann, who, before joining EyeNetra, was a postdoctoral researcher in mammography at Harvard Medical School. “What people want is a fully automated experience where they don’t have to learn or do anything complicated. Our technology now allows people to simply stand in front of our units.” Eyebot-generated prescriptions are finalized by teledoctors within 24 hours, and consumers who want to purchase glasses from any retailer must pay $30 for an exam. But if they purchase glasses from one of Eyebot’s partner brands, the vision exam is free. The technology is registered with the FDA, Hofmann said. The company hopes that major eyeglass brands will rent Eyebot terminals and put them in the retail locations of their choice. Once a shopper finalizes their exam, they can choose to buy eyeglasses from that brand directly on a touchscreen within the kiosk or by using their smartphone. Eyebot plans to make money by partnering with these eyewear brands and taking a commission on each sale. “Retailers are looking for new channels to reach the customers,” Hofmann said. “Now they have an opportunity to show their brand in CVS, Walgreens, Stop and Shop, Kroger and on college campuses.” Eyebot is close to finalizing partnership agreements with several large eyeglass and contact lens merchants, Hofmann said. “It’s a very lucrative model. The demand for what we’re doing is very high.” Demand for investing in Eyebot’s seed round was high, too, according to Hofmann. On Thursday, the company announced a $6 million funding round led by AlleyCorp and Ubiquity Ventures with participation from Humba Ventures, Village Global, Baukunst, Ravelin, and Spacecadet. The capital will be used for expansion to other geographies."
2023-03-06,"ADHD startups are exploding, and now there’s even a dedicated browser",Apps,"Was it the pandemic? Did everyone follow too many ADHD TikTokers? Have smartphones fried our brains? Whatever the case, there is a boom in ADHD tech solutions, from online drug deliveries to web sites and apps. There’s definitely something going on out there. According to research, some 366.33 million adults globally had persistent ADHD symptoms in 2020. Adults with ADHD are said to lose an average of 22 days of productivity per year. And between 2003-2011 the U.S. faced a 42% growth in childhood ADHD diagnosis. And the mental health space (of which ADHD is a part) took off a couple of years ago. Venture capitalists put $1.4 billion into the European mental health sector in 2021, according to Dealroom data, but investment shrunk to $354 million last year as VCs took flight in the downturn, more generally. However, there is still plenty of activity. London-based HelloSelf matches patients with licensed therapists and covers a range of mental health conditions, including ADHD. Out of New York, Inflow, an app that supposedly helps members better manage ADHD through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) based support raised an $11 million Series A round led by Octopus Ventures. Centered is a desktop app that provides an AI voice coaches to help ADHD sufferers stay focused, (with Pomodoro timers, calendaring, etc.) and also has “Buddy Sessions” between members and for productivity and ADHD coaches. Ukrainian-originated startup Numo is an app for adults with ADHD that gamifies daily tasks and get support. Healios raised a £7 million ($9.9 million) Series A round to expand its platform across the U.K. Now there is a Sidekick, who’s pitch is that it’s a “productivity browser.” Today it’s launching a host of features geared to ADHD sufferers and the attention distracted more generally. Sidekick was a 2020 Y Combinator cohort member, and in March 2021 it raised $2 million in a round led by Kleiner Perkins. The company claims users with ADHD noticed a “significant improvement” after using the browser. The Chromium-based browser was founded by Dmitry Pushkarev (a Stanford PhD in Molecular Biology, ex-Amazon exec and ADHDer). So how does it work? To nullify distractions, the browser incorporates AdBlock 2.0; a Focus Mode Timer disables all sounds, badges and notifications for a selected time or indefinitely; a Task Manager organizes your day; and there’s a built-in Pomodoro timer; it also claims to run 3x faster than Chrome, which, apparently, is important for ADHD sufferers. Suffice it to say, it has a number of other distraction-killing features; however, I’m not going to list them all here. CEO and founder Dmitry Pushkarev said, in a statement, “Modern browsers are not designed for work, but for consuming web pages. This gap really hurts hundreds of millions of users. We are convinced that lowering web distraction reduces anxiety and increases the quality of people’s work and the quality of their lives.” He says the startup plans to make money via corporate subscribers, who will pay to get their ADHD-afflicted workers into a more productive mode. Unfortunately for Sidekick, it has plenty of competitors in the attention-reducing browser space, including Arc, Brave and Vivaldi. With all that said, Sidekick’s attention (geddit?) to ADHD may win it a valuable niche, especially given the apparent pandemic of ADHD sufferers."
2023-06-12,"Oova grabs another $10.3M, unveils membership model for at-home fertility testing",Biotech & Health,"One in six people are expected to be affected by infertility at some point in their lives, and with the cost of procedures, like in vitro fertilization, costing tens of thousands of dollars for each procedure, more people seek better ways to understand their reproductive health. There are a number of startups tackling this issue, for example, Generation Prime, Flo, Future Family, Maven and Mate Fertility, which all received funding within the past few years. Oova, a women’s health and fertility startup working in the fertility-tracking segment of the market, is the latest to get additional venture-backed funding, raising $10.3 million in Series A funding for its at-home approach to translating a woman’s fertility. It is also launching the Oova Membership. Priced at $99 per month, the membership includes The Oova Kit and offers features, such as personalized support via the Oova Provider network of healthcare professionals and hormone experts and access to a community of people going through similar fertility journeys. Oova raises $1.2M to develop a better at-home kit for detecting a woman’s best time to conceive Oova was previously profiled in 2021 when founder and CEO Amy Divaraniya, Ph.D. officially launched its at-home urine test, called Oova Kit, with $1.2 million in seed funding. The test comes with 15 days of testing strips and measures the luteinizing hormone and progesterone to provide advanced personalized analytics and real-time action plans so a woman can know her most fertile days and confirm ovulation. Oova’s Oova Kit, an at-home fertility test. (Image Credit: Red Antler) It is FDA registered, and the company touts it is the “only product that allows its users to sync and share results with their doctor in real time.” Divaraniya told TechCrunch that talk within the fertility industry, especially following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, shifted to data security, and unlike other period and fertility tracking companies, Oova was always HIPAA compliant and invested in secure connections with its clinic partners. Divaraniya was mum about the company’s growth over the past year, but did say Oova is now working with over 100 clinics, up from 75 at the launch in 2021. In addition, the company has trained its model on over 10,000 cycles monitored through the platform. “We’ve also seen a massive increase in the adoption across both consumer and clinical channels,” Divaraniya said. “Because of the adoption, it led to one of the most powerful datasets in the industry. This is a dream of information to work with. Not only do we have daily hormone measurements across tens of thousands of cycles, but we also have treatment data. We’ve been able to train our algorithms on actual hormone information across thousands of women, and then even look at intrapersonal data to understand the nuances between cycles for a single woman, leading to a very personalized experience for our users.” Meanwhile, Spero Ventures led the new round and was joined by US Fertility, Virgin Group, Jefferson Health, Connecticut Innovations, Hannah Bronfman and Spanx founder Sara Blakely. In total, the company raised $11.5 million. “Oova has revolutionized the way we understand our hormonal health,” said Sara Eshelman, partner at Spero Ventures, in a written statement. “By making clinical-grade hormone monitoring convenient and cost-effective for daily use, Oova is empowering its users to understand their cycles, improve fertility outcomes and manage their symptoms.” Divaraniya said Oova went after a new funding round when its technology reached some heavy adoption and the company received feedback from physicians asking for Oova to test additional hormones. Patients are also using Oova’s technology for use cases that it wasn’t initially designed for, like the early part of pregnancy and postpartum, but are finding value in the data. In addition, the company is eyeing all other phases of a women’s health. “We started off with fertility because it’s a place that I’m very passionate about, but what is also very clear is that all the different phases of a woman’s life are dictated by hormones,” she said. “If you can understand the different patterns that happen in classic urban spaces, you can actually start adjusting those.” 8 investors discuss what’s ahead for reproductive health startups in a post-Roe world"
2023-02-10,From shipping container to table: Adapt brings urban mushroom farms to US,Climate,"Canadian vertical farming startup Adapt AgTech is partnering with Reef Technology to bring its mushroom-growing shipping containers to major cities across the United States, starting with Austin. Reef transforms urban real estate like parking lots into mobility and logistical hubs and currently operates over 8,000 locations across hundreds of cities. The partnership will help Adapt place its shipping containers steps away from such customers as restaurants and grocery stores, without having to pay the astronomical rent of a commercial or industrial space in a downtown area. Adapt opened its first shipping container in Austin and began deliveries to restaurants this week. Over the course of the next few years, the startup plans to expand to over 50 locations, including Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Miami. “Our model is to create hyper-local farms in densely populated urban areas to reduce the distance from farm to fork,” Jonathan Murray, Adapt AgTech’s CEO and founder, told TechCrunch. Adapt’s network of shipping container farms specializes in “aberrant gourmet mushrooms,” which are gourmet mushrooms that haven’t been available in North American retail until very recently. Think pink, yellow, blue and king oysters, chestnut mushrooms, and the trending lion’s mane. “Mushrooms cater very, very well to container farming versus other crops like leafy greens because of the energy consumption,” continued Murray. “They don’t require a tremendous amount of light. It’s really just temperature and humidity.” Adapt, which launched in February 2022, delivered its first farm in June last year to a location in Toronto. The company has been growing ever since and now has farms in Ottawa, Vancouver, Halifax, Kingston and Austin. On February 17, Adapt says it will launch a partnership with Loblaws — Canada’s largest retailer — starting with two flagship stores in downtown Toronto, and then dozens more in Toronto and Ottawa before expanding elsewhere over the following months. Adapt will also roll out with retail banners under Canadian grocery chains Sobeys and Pattison Food Group in 2023. “By the end of 2023 we’ll be available in stores of at least three of the top five largest retailers in Canada from Halifax to Vancouver and in between, which combined represent over 3,500 stores,” said Murray. Adapt recently closed a seed round with climate VC Congruent, and it will use the funds to expand its base and hire more support. Sustainable fruiting, cheaper mushrooms Image Credits: Adapt AgTech Adapt AgTech designs and manufactures its shipping containers in Delta, British Columbia. Aside from the five containers operating today, Adapt recently started production on 16 more units and is aiming to deploy over 25 units over the next 12 months. Some of Adapt’s shipping containers are solar-powered with backup plugs, but for the purposes of a speedy U.S. launch, the startup will plug its shipping containers into the grid. The energy consumption, Murray said, is low — about 10 kilowatt hours per day. The company’s distribution model is akin to a hub and spoke. Adapt uses a centralized hub in Kingston, Ontario, to do all of the lab work and colonize the substrate blocks — meaning it allows the mycelium, the root structure of the fungus, to grow on blocks of sawdust, spent coffee grounds or coconut coir. The startup then sends out the blocks to shipping containers, where the mushrooms can fruit close to customers. Murray says this allows Adapt to deliver mushrooms within a couple of hours of harvest, which not only means fresher fungi, but also longer-lasting mushrooms and reduced spoilage. The startup deploys and operates the containers and also fulfills orders. An operator oversees everything from harvesting to managing orders to delivering mushrooms. “All of our containers are currently operating essentially on one full-time farmer, so we’re enabling them to become what we like to call ‘farmtrepreneurs,’” said Murray. “So uncapped commissions, grow your territory as big as you can. We’ll add containers, we’ll grow your territories. This allows us to bring new and young people into farming as well, which is exciting.” Murray also noted that existing mushroom farm operators have reached out to Adapt to flip their at-home businesses into Adapt farms. The whole process allows the startup to stay vertically integrated, and thus save money on materials like substrate, which Adapt makes itself out of whatever is locally available. Adapt’s control over each farm also lets the company keep tabs on well-fruiting mushroom strains and propagate more of them, delivering even healthier margins to the company and a high-quality product that’s cheaper than what you’d get at the farmer’s market, said Murray.

2023-06-29,"Lightspeed makes first investment in Africa, backing Ghana’s Berry Health",Biotech & Health,"Sexual and mental health stigmatization in Africa has evolved over several decades to a point where negligence to address the issue has led to the continent topping the charts in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mental health cases. For one, around 11 people per 100,000 die by suicide in Africa yearly, according to the World Health Organization; that’s compared to the global average of nine per 100,000 people. In addition, the sub-Saharan region is second only to Southeast Asia in the highest incidence of STIs, with over 80 million cases annually. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling the stigma around sexual and mental health in Africa considering sporadic governmental efforts. To this end, Berry Health, a several- months-old Ghanaian startup, is throwing its hat into the ring, like many other startups, off the back of a $1.6 million pre-seed round co-led by U.S.-based large-size funds Lightspeed Venture Partners (its first investment in Africa) and General Catalyst. In an interview with TechCrunch, Berry Health founder and CEO Fredua Akosa said the health tech startup is “bringing judgment-free health care in a 21st-century way in a continent where stigma cuts deeper and is affecting so many lives.” Akosa has had quite the career. After moving from London, where he grew up, to Ghana, where he completed medical school, the chief executive practiced as a general practitioner for five years in hospitals around rural and urban areas. But at Yale, where he was advancing his studies in public health as a researcher, and later at Oxford during his MBA, Akosa said he discovered tech’s place in healthcare to “impact lives at scale.” “During the pandemic, I’d come over to Ghana to visit family and of course, I had a lot of patients, including family members and friends, asking for free consultations. During that period, I realized a massive explosion in mental health conditions and conditions around stigmatized health care,” said the British-Ghanaian medical doctor. “People felt so embarrassed going to the hospital and talking about things they felt ashamed of when they shouldn’t have. That was the genesis for me for Berry: just realizing that there is a huge need to break stigma in health through technology.” If Africa having the highest rates of suicide, clinically diagnosed depression and sexually transmitted infections globally paints a stark picture of the continent, the continent’s low ratio of doctors to individuals (1:10,000) paints a starker picture (in contrast to 30 doctors per 10,000 people in the U.S. and 37 doctors per 10,000 in Europe). The good news, however, is that with help from pandemic-changing behaviors, this situation has accelerated the use of telemedicine, virtual care and drug-delivery platforms in Africa, fueling investor interest in Africa’s health tech in recent years; Yodawy, Reliance Health, Healthtracka, Helium Health, Esaal and MyHealth Africa are a few beneficiaries across the continent. Nigerian at-home lab testing platform Healthtracka gets $1.5M, backed by female VCs The models employed by these startups have democratized access to healthcare services traditionally limited to in-person, often expensive consultations. They also enable a broader range of consumers to control their health and wellness, eliminating barriers that have hindered access to quality care. As such, Berry Health, starting with customers from Ghana, offers remote diagnosis — for conditions such as anxiety, depression and sexual health (e.g., birth control and erectile dysfunction), dermatology and hair loss — through telemedicine and treatment via online consultations and home delivery services. On the platform, customers can talk to a licensed medical doctor or clinical psychologist, have a curated personal treatment plan for their conditions, and then get medications delivered. “These are some areas we’re focused on: mental health, dermatology, hair loss and sexual health conditions that generally people feel too embarrassed to go to the hospital. We’re super excited about the number of other players in healthcare because we know how complex the general healthcare problem is, me being a practitioner,” said the CEO. “But our focus is stigma and we want to make people comfortable in seeking care, not feel judged or as if they’re wrong for seeking treatment.” The subscription-based platform plans to charge 299GH ($26) yearly for users to access all its services and $5 per consultation with clinicians (Akosa said this fee is 25% less than what is typically charged in Ghana for instance). Berry Health — whose executive team includes professionals from WPP, Instacart and Babylon Health and a medical advisory board comprising gynecologists, dermatologists and several other specialists — has signed several doctors and clinicians and intends to emerge out of stealth at the end of next month, according to Akosa. Image Credits: Berry Health Most of Berry Health’s executive team have worked for several years in the U.S. and Europe, raising some concern that their expertise might not be suitable for the African health tech market, which has peculiar challenges. Akosa, addressing this, opines that it was paramount for the Accra- and London-based health upstart to put together a team from “diverse regions, views, and perspectives (including himself and several clinical psychologists on the ground) to tackle Africa’s healthcare problems.” “It’s more difficult for many companies in Europe and the U.S. to achieve the kind of healthcare revolution that Fredua is trying to achieve in Africa because, in addition to their medical systems being complicated and expensive, there are many regulations, rules and restrictions. But there’s an opportunity to do more with Africa with a team like this,” said Paul Murphy, partner at Lightspeed, on a call with TechCrunch, when asked about Berry Health’s team structure. After concluding his MBA at Oxford, Akosa moved into venture capital as an associate at Northzone, where he worked with Murphy, including in a Series A investment into New York–based healthcare services, Thirty Madison. The doctor-cum-investor-cum-founder went on to work at growth for one of Europe’s fastest-growing startups: $10 billion quick-commerce upstart Flink. “He’s got a CV that you could only dream of, plus we’ve got this underserved market, a business model that we know works well in the U.S. and Europe. These are all the ingredients for what could be a phenomenal business that helps people. That’s why we got so excited about it so quickly,” added Murphy, on why Lightspeed, which has successfully backed several healthcare businesses in various markets such as Aledade, Wheel and Air Doctor, made its first investment in Africa via Berry Health. Other investors in the health tech’s pre-seed round include Reddit COO Jen Wong; Thirty Madison co-founders Demetri Karagas and Steven Gutentag; New York tech lawyer and VC Ed and Betsy Zimmerman; and former U.S. Surgeon General under the Obama administration Regina Benjamin."
2022-11-22,Visible launches activity-tracking platform to tackle long COVID,Biotech & Health,"A new activity-tracking platform is launching out of stealth today with $1 million in pre-seed funding, with a view toward helping those suffering from long COVID track and manage their symptoms. Visible is the brainchild of Harry Leeming, a London-based engineer who says he has suffered from long COVID for the past two years, and Luke Martin-Fuller. The global pandemic’s end may be within eyeshot for many, but millions of people globally still suffer long-term effects from COVID-19, with studies suggesting that anywhere between 20% and 40% of those who have contracted COVID-19 experience ongoing symptoms such as mild fatigue, “brain fog,” headaches, sickness, weakness and respiratory problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that “at least” 17 million people in Europe alone experienced long COVID in the first two years of the pandemic, a figure that rises to as high as 145 million globally. But with much of the healthcare realm still trying to piece together the long COVID puzzle, Visible is going to market to help sufferers address what is widely considered to be the number one long COVID symptom. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) describes the worsening of a condition’s symptoms following even minor physical exertion, and it’s also common in ME/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). One way to counter the effects of PEM is to adopt a “pacing” strategy, which involves performing a delicate balancing act between rest and activity. Through a consumer wearable and smartphone app, Visible wants to help millions of people do just that, and it’s launching the first part of its product in open beta today. Visible co-founders: CEO Harry Leeming (left) with COO Luke Martin-Fuller. Image Credits: Visible Making the invisible visible In its initial guise, Visible is available as a free mobile app, with plans to introduce a premium subscription in the U.S. and U.K. in the coming months. This will include a Polar Verity Sense heart-rate monitor (HRM), designed to be worn on the upper arm to capture the necessary data passively throughout the day. For now, though, Visible works entirely through manual data inputs via morning and evening check-ins. This includes measuring heart-rate variability (HRV) — the time in between each heartbeat — which can be an indicator of a person’s health and well-being. So how can Visible track this when it’s not actively supporting a heart-rate monitor yet? Well smartphone cameras can help via a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG), which has been shown to be a somewhat effective alternative to ECG in terms of analyzing HRV in humans. Essentially, Visible uses PPG to detect small changes in a person’s skin color, with the user placing their finger over the lens of their camera for a 60-second period each morning. “These changes allow us to measure the time between heartbeats and calculate heart rate and heart rate variability,” Leeming explained to TechCrunch. Over time, Visible helps users track their symptoms and spot trends. Visible app in action. Image Credits: Visible Continuous tracking With continuous tracking via a physical HRM, however, Visible promises to be far more effective in terms of helping users adopt an effective pacing strategy, ensure that they don’t over-exert themselves and allow their bodies more time to recover. This will include real-time data and notifications when it detects that the user is doing too much activity that can make their existing symptoms worse and curtail recovery. “This approach is consistent with published research, which shows that alerts of this kind can improve functional outcomes for people living with post-viral illness,” Leeming said. “This works because post-viral illness leads to a compromised aerobic energy system. By keeping your activity levels below a certain threshold, you can avoid a broken energy metabolism response that leads to exacerbated symptoms.” Visible Plus subscription provides users with insights and prompts. Image Credits: Visible Using data garnered passively from a wearable allows Visible to generate illness-specific metrics, or digital biomarkers as they’re known, which allows people to make decisions based on “hard numbers” rather than subjective estimates of the severity of their condition. For example, those who pay for a Visible Plus subscription and use the accompanying wearable will benefit from accelerometer and gyroscope data from the Polar Verity Sense. This allows Visible to determine things like “orthostatic intolerance,” or the body’s biological response from moving into an upright position from lying down. This can show the impact that changing one’s posture has on a change in heart rate. In terms of pricing, this has yet to be finalized, but Leeming said that it will be in the rough ballpark of other consumer subscription services à la Netflix or Spotify. So we’re probably talking in the region of around $10 per month, give or take. If someone already has their own Polar Verity Sense armband, Visible says it will offer the subscription at a discount rate, and there could be scope to extend support to devices from other manufacturers. “We anticipate that we will support a wider range of wearable devices in the future,” Leeming said. Startups vs. long COVID Visible isn’t alone in trying to expedite long COVID treatments and research, as we’ve seen a number of new ventures arrive on the scene over the past couple of years. One of those is a nonprofit startup called the Long COVID Research Initiative (LCRI) which recently launched with $15 million in funding from Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin to study and develop treatments for long COVID. The LCRI was kickstarted by a Googler and long COVID sufferer who decided to take things into his own hands after becoming frustrated at the lack of urgency in many of the government-led programs. And there are clear comparisons with Visible’s path to launch today. “Long COVID has turned my life upside down — millions, like me, have still not recovered from COVID and are struggling every day,” Leeming said. “There is no clear diagnosis, no pharmaceutical treatment and little recognition from the government as to how widespread and how life-changing these conditions are. Patients like myself have little option but to build the disease management tools that are badly needed — tools specifically designed for people living with long COVID, but also those with similarly dismissed chronic conditions like ME/CFS, chronic Lyme and fibromyalgia.” It’s also worth noting here that Visible users can opt in to contribute their symptom and biometric data to third-party researchers studying long COVID. By way of example, Leeming said that it has a research partnership in place with Imperial College London, and it’s working with a team of academics who are currently researching the impact of the menstrual cycle on long COVID symptoms. Visible also has an advisory board of specialists in post-viral conditions, including Dr. David Putrino who is director of rehabilitation innovation at Mount Sinai, and Dr. David Strain, medical advisor at ActionForME, U.K. “Long COVID and ME/CFS are incredibly debilitating and widespread diseases that we urgently need to better understand and help patients to manage,” Strain said in a statement issued to TechCrunch. “Visible is the first tool to really help patients to measure and manage their own disease using only their smartphone. Just as importantly, it will be instrumental in helping clinicians and researchers advance our knowledge of the diseases too.” Visible’s pre-seed round of funding was co-led by Octopus Ventures, Calm/Storm and Hustle Fund, with participation from a number of angel backers. Leeming said that more than 4,500 people were on the waitlist for the Visible app, a number it hopes will increase now that it’s officially available on Android and iOS."
2023-10-31,Cambrium aims to one-up nature with designer proteins that scale sustainably,AI,"Nature has done a hell of a job over the last few billion years, but there’s always room for improvement. The proteins in our bodies are great but not always the easiest to produce or package — so Cambrium is looking to design improved molecules that work in similar ways, but can be made at sustainably and at scale, and vegan to boot. And yes, AI is involved. The company has raised €11 million (around $11.6M) to expand its operations from its proof of concept product, a custom derivative of collagen called NovaColl, to a new slate of structural proteins that could be used in personal care and fashion. Collagen is a good example of the kind of molecule that makes a lot of sense to make a few changes to. It’s the most common protein in your body, found in practically all your tissues, and drops in collagen levels are associated with wrinkles and other outward signs of aging. The efficacy of collagen supplements, whether oral or topical, is debatable, but it’s definitely both harmless and popular. There are two problems, though: first, collagen that’s biosimilar to human collagen has to be sourced from animals, generally waste from meat processing. Not great! And second, natural collagen is too large a molecule to really penetrate the skin and do whatever it’s supposed to do. Cambrium got to work on it in the company’s early stages, isolating the region of the protein that seemed to do the most work and modifying it to be manufacturable in a bioreactor – basically a lot a specialized microbes that eat sugar and excrete the molecule in question. The resulting NovaColl molecule, smaller and easier to make, appears to stimulate collagen production better than the real thing, and it’s done without rendering any organs. Image Credits: Cambrium It’s a validation of the approach, showing that there are potentially useful molecules out there being produced in rather nasty ways, and both can be improved. CEO and founder Mitchell Duffy explained, however, that the company is not interested in medications or enzymes, which are used at industrial scales. Instead, they’re focusing on “structural” proteins, which are valuable for their physical properties. “A lot of biotech has been focused on enzymes for many years, and structural proteins, until the last decade or so, have fallen by the wayside — but I think they’re some of the higher value proteins out there,” he said. “We’re used to interacting with structural proteins every day, and we need new paradigms in how to create them.” Allozymes looks to upend chemical manufacturing with rapid enzyme engineering and $5M seed He suggested silk as an example. Harvested en masse from silkworms, but what we value about it isn’t that it’s bug-based textile. Its value comes from its structural properties, how strands of it are straight and smooth at a molecular level, without the curls or spikes of, say, wool (another valuable structural protein). “We’re not working on this, but what if you could reduce the pile in some much cheaper bulk material? Then you could have a silk-like feel for a fraction of the price, and it would be vegan, or more sustainable,” he explained. Targeting structure and function rather than adhering to a strict amino acid sequence (though NovaColl did) confers considerable leeway in the design process. “Making natural proteins is sometimes more difficult; Evolution optimizes for different things than human needs,” said Duffy. “So if we digitally design proteins, we can optimize for human needs, and you can design for scale. A lot of companies are all about finding the perfect protein and then scaling it up. We’re saying, let’s design a protein that scales to start with.” Here’s where that AI hook comes in. Surprisingly, it’s not simply algorithmic or bio-specific, because proteins have “that language feel,” as Duffy put it. “Proteins have a structure like a sentence has a structure, there are words and you can swap them out and get the same meaning but a different intonation or connotation. That’s what we’re doing, we’re forming new sentences. We created a new programing language that lets us put constraints on this generator we have — it’s a model that’s been trained on a ton of data, so it really is a generative AI.” They’re working on both modifying naturally occurring proteins and designing them from scratch. Rather than taking on something industrial in scale, however, Cambrium is hoping to address high-value, low-volume industries like personal care. “It’s just a perfect place to start: low minimum quantities, high prices, people are super interested in it, they want to see data but they’re also open to innovation. And textiles treatments are everywhere — not only in woven materials, there are tons used in leather. And there may be more sustainable options,” Duffy said. The seed funding round was led by Essential Capital, along with SNR, Valor Equity Partners, and HOF Capital, as well as Merantix, out of whose AI venture studio in Berlin the company emerged. Duffy noted that Europe (Cambrium is based in Berlin) has good public funding for this kind of work, allowing them to experiment and develop their processes using grants — “That’s one of the ways we have been able to be so capital efficient and get to market, instead of spending VC dollars on stuff in the lower TRL [tech readiness level] scale.” NovaColl is shipping to customers now, who are using and testing it in their products, so the market is no longer theoretical. Cambrium’s next molecule or molecules aren’t being revealed yet, but we should hear more soon now that this funding is charging up operations."
2023-03-12,Medigo’s app makes prescription deliveries available 24/7 in Vietnam,Biotech & Health,"Over the last three years, Ho Chi Minh City-based Medigo has grown to 500,000 active users by providing 24/7 one-demand prescription delivery services. Now it’s planning to grow its telehealth ecosystem with $2 million in new funding by East Ventures, with participation from Pavilion Capital and Touchstone Partners. The new capital will allow Medigo to expand its remote doctor consultations, medicine delivery services and home testing services, including blood tests, urine tests and pregnancy tests. Medigo’s app connects users to nearby licenses pharmacies and delivers medicine within 20 minutes. It currently has 1,000 pharmacy partners in Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s three biggest cities, and will began expanding to Tier 2 cities, like Binh Duong, Vung Tau and Hai Phong, this year. The startup’s CEO and co-fouder Ha Le began working on the app after he had trouble finding fever reducers for his daughter in the middle of the night. “When I was in university as a software engineer, I never thought that working in the healthcare space would be the center of my daily life, but now, it is my life’s mission,” he told TechCrunch. Medigo has plenty of competitors, including Doctor Anywhere, Jio Health, Edoctor, Long Chau, Pharmacity and Rightnow. Le said Medigo differentiates by working with pharmacies that are open around the clock so it is able to operate 24/7 consistently. It also plans to connect different providers, so users can have more choices on the same platform. In a statement about the investment, East Ventures managing partner Koh Wai Kit said, “Digital technologies can improve the accessibility and affordability of good quality healthcare. We are excited by Medigo’s mission to revolutionize pharmacies and healthcare services in Vietnam.” Biotech proved a surprisingly bright spot in 2022’s startup correction"
2022-11-08,"Elizabeth Holmes is denied new trial, will be sentenced on Nov. 18",Biotech & Health,"The disgraced founder of Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes will be sentenced on November 18 after she was found guilty on four counts of defrauding investors in January. Once the youngest self-made female billionaire, Holmes could face up to 20 years in prison for each of the four counts of fraud. Holmes had delayed sentencing by trying to request a new trial, arguing that new evidence had come to light. In August, former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff visited Holmes at her home in an attempt to find closure. Rosendorff, who worked at Theranos between 2013 and 2014, testified for six days last year during Holmes’ four-month trial. With his highly technical knowledge of the inner workings of Theranos’ labs, Rosendorff’s testimony was key to the trial. In court, he said that Holmes knew that Theranos’ technology produced inaccurate blood test results, yet she pushed for it to be used on patients anyway. After repeatedly raising his concerns about the faulty technology, he ultimately quit Theranos. Holmes’ lawyers alleged that when Rosendorff visited her home this summer, he expressed guilt that he made Theranos seem worse than it was in court. But Judge Edward Davila did not find merit to these allegations. Rosendorff affirmed once again that last year’s testimony was accurate. The former lab director clarified that he felt sorry for Holmes’ child, who will grow up without a mother if she is sent to prison, but not for Holmes herself. After a long-delayed trial, Holmes’ legal team is expected to file an appeal after next week’s sentencing, dragging out the legal process further. Holmes’ former boyfriend and Theranos COO, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani is expected to be sentenced on December 7. While Holmes was found guilty on four counts of fraud relating to investors, Balwani was found guilty on all 12 counts of defrauding and conspiring to defraud both patients and investors.

2022-12-01,"Zoe, which went viral with its COVID-reporting app, raises $30M to track nutrition and health",Apps,"Zoe, a startup founded by doctors and researchers out of London and Boston, made its name during the pandemic with a popular — dare we say viral? — self-reporting COVID-19 app. Embraced both by consumers and researchers, it provided early data into how COVID-19 spread and the symptoms associated with the initial infection and its lingering after-effects (long COVID) — insights that were hard to come by virtually anywhere else. Then as the virus moved from pandemic to endemic and attention shifted to other ways of tracking, Zoe also shifted, back to its original, pre-COVID mission: using self-reporting tech to track and build a nutrition study of the microbiome, and to provide personalized insights to individual users of its app based on their reporting of what and how they eat and the wider insights gained from the research. That app is now is taking the next step in scaling its operations, as it looks to onboard 250,000 people off a waiting list it has had going for over a year: It’s announcing £25 million in funding (around $30 million at today’s rates), an equity investment that CEO Jonathan Wolf said values Zoe at $250 million (£209 million). U.S.-based venture firm Accomplice is leading the round, with previous backers Balderton Capital, Ahren, Daphni and new backer L Catterton also participating. The funding comes on the heels of a Series B of £48 million, which closed with a $20 million injection in May 2021 (a number that bumped up to $25 million after we published our story). Since then, it has onboarded some 50,000 active paying users, alongside the nearly 5 million people who have self-reported nutritional data free of charge. Wolf said that most of the last round is still in the bank; the latest funding is an opportunistic extension, made to shore up capital in the face of potentially stormy waters in the markets next year. “We are seeing a big acceleration in customer demand so what we want to do is scale our business significantly to be able to meet that demand,” Wolf said. “Given the tough economic environment, we wanted to make sure we have the capital to do this. In fact, the vast majority of the $25 million raised in the last round is still in the company.” And alongside the venture round, it’s also hoping to bring on more interest through a crowdfunding campaign. Taking into its wider community of interest that Zoe says numbers 2 million (this likely includes many who follow Zoe and have provided contact details by way of its previous COVID work, but it also has a podcast and related content) it will be running a campaign for investing via crowdfunding site Crowdcube. That will open on December 13 to that community and a day later to Crowdcube users, and then to the public at large, with investing starting at £10, “at the same share price as ZOE’s private investors.” In addition to onboarding more users waiting to join, the plan also is for Zoe to expand beyond diet. “We are looking to deepen our research into nutrition, the gut microbiome, sleep, mood, activity and other factors to improve long-term health,” said Wolf, who co-founded the startup with Professor Tim Spector of King’s College London and George Hadjigeorgiou. It plans also to expand research and studies in the ZOE Health Study; with a greater number and variety of health and lifestyle studies advocated by our contributors and scientists that will cover areas like menopause and more. While it does not have plans to build any of its own hardware — it does send out glucose monitors and other physical products as part of its assessment (see below) but these are not made by Zoe — it will be making more integrations with hardware already out in the market, an approach that is essential for triangulating data and getting more complete pictures of each individual reporting, which is essentially a big data analytics exercise. “I don’t see us doing anything in hardware. So many are already in this area and it’s exciting to take inputs from a variety of them. No single measure is more important or determines something. It will take a combination,” he said. “In the future we’re excited about integrations with Apple Watch and more.” The reason for the slow movement in bringing those waiting off the list is because of the process involved in doing so — one reason for the funding injection to speed up how it scales. The 50,000 active users it has have opted to pay £299.99 initially to get a test kit to run an initial analysis of their systems. The price is high, Wolf said, because it includes a gut microbiome test, a blood fat test, standardised test meals of muffins (!) and real-time blood sugar sensor (CGM) if opted in to their science study; in return they get a gut health report and a personalised insights report. Users are then given an option to take on memberships at different price points to continue the work and insights. These start at £59.99/month and go down to £24.99/month if you take out an annual subscription. In a consumer world of health apps that include free, ad-supported options, it’s a big ask for users to step up and put hundreds of dollars into a service to improve how they eat. Wolf said that Zoe had found that one of the lasting impacts of the pandemic was that there’s been a shift in how the general public regarded their health and the role that their activities played in it. “I think the pandemic has had a profound impact on how people think about their health,” he said. “They noticed how what they do and how they eat and exercise impacted on a disease. That doesn’t mean everyone is healthier but now more see that it’s not something you wait to do until you’re sick. You have to take responsibility for it and add to it over time.” Indeed, COVID-19 saw a boom in activity: people were walking, cycling and running more; some were buying more fitness equipment for their homes when their gyms or sports clubs closed; and generally more people were trying to do more not just to be healthy in case they too got hit by the virus, but because they were no longer coming into work every day and found themselves more sedentary by default. Of course, there’s been a big shift back to old pre-COVID ways, but there has also been a lingering shift, which is something that Zoe hopes to play into — not least because of its traction with users during the peak of the pandemic, when it had amassed more than 5 million users in the U.S. and U.K. for its symptom tracking app. Zoe has naturally conducted a study on its users — 500 of them — and says that those actively following its program for 12 weeks or more said they felt “healtier” following Zoe recommendations. “Their top improvements were: improved mood & alertness, better bowel habits, improved blood sugar & fat, less bloating and better sleep quality,” said Wolf. Some 85% said they had reduced constipation, reduced bloating, improved mood and reduced diarrhea, he said; and 70% said they had more energy and less bloating. It’s running a larger randomized study now to get more insights, which will be ready next year, he added. “Zoe’s impact to date has been huge. Their science, insights and advice have already benefited hundreds of thousands across the U.K. and the world,” said Sarah Downey, operating partner at Accomplice. “We are really excited to see what’s next as they deepen their understanding of the microbiome, nutrition, sleep, exercise and other factors to bring science to everybody and help change their lives, for the better.” Additional reporting by Natasha Lomas."
2023-06-22,Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media,Biotech & Health,"If you’ve been paying attention to the food tech industry lately, you saw a lot of movement in the past week around both Good Meat and Upside Foods receiving U.S. Department of Agriculture approval to commercially sell their respective cultivated chicken products in the U.S. Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, not only wants to be the next one to achieve similar regulatory approval, it believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat that can run thousands of dollars per liter. The company, founded by Ali Khademhosseini four years ago, was developed at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation. Prior to starting Omeat, Khademhosseini was growing human tissues for medical applications after studying at MIT. As he learned more about animal agricultural practices, he shifted his focus to developing a scalable method for growing cultivated meat. Omeat has a patent-pending technological approach that “enables the cultivation of any meat in a way that is orders-of-magnitude more sustainable and humane than the conventional approach,” CEO Khademhosseini told TechCrunch. He explained that the process uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media, which is a big driver of the high cost of cultivated meat, and why some companies choose to make their own. Plasma collection from the cows happens weekly and is similar to how humans donate plasma, Khademhosseini said. And not just from any cow, but Omeat specifically sources growth media from free-roaming herd cows that graze on its regenerative farm in California designed in collaboration with Kristina Horback at UC Davis. It is then developed into the growth media, and that one type of media can then be used to grow any kind of meat, including beef, pork, chicken or fish. Omeat is starting with beef. The company is currently building a pilot plant and expanding its team toward commercial readiness after raising $40 million of Series A capital in 2022 from investors, including S2G Ventures, Google Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, Tyson Ventures, Rethink Food, Trailhead Capital and Cavallo Ventures. Omeat scaled its current plant capacity to 200-liter bioreactors, and the pilot plant will have the ability to scale bioreactors to 2,000 liters and 10,000 liters, which Khademhosseini said are the sizes needed, based on global demand, to generate meat at cost parity with traditional beef. “One cow providing plasma weekly can create many cows’ worth of meat annually,” Khademhosseini said. “Our vision is to make this so economically viable that we will have lots of people from the existing food supply world actually encouraged to partner with us in order to raise profits and address the razor-thin margins that exist right now.” We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production"
2023-02-13,Samsung adds temperature-based period tracking to its Galaxy Watch5,Biotech & Health,"Samsung’s Galaxy Watch5 will now offer improved period tracking features thanks to a new partnership with Natural Cycles that leverages the smartwatch’s temperature sensors to make better predictions. The launch follows last fall’s announcement of a new temperature sensor on the Apple Watch Series 8 that similarly allows wearers to improve their period predictions as well as view retrospective ovulation estimates when the watch is worn overnight. According to Samsung, the advanced period-tracking features will become available to smartwatch owners across 32 countries globally, including North America, Europe, and Asia. It explains that Natural Cycles has developed an algorithm that uses body temperature and other fertility indicators to make predictions about fertility. This will be used along with the Watch5’s new infrared sensor to track skin temperature changes overnight. The data is encrypted and stored on the device, Samsung says, where it’s used to power its Health app’s Cycle Tracking feature. Samsung had been late to market to launch its own period tracking feature, only adding the option to its Health app in 2020, long after Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, and other third-party apps had done so. But the manual period tracking method is reliant on historical data to make predictions — and that can only go so far. Adding the ability to track temperature changes can improve its accuracy. “The Natural Cycles app has helped millions of women around the world take control of their fertility and this partnership will allow Samsung to leverage our fertility technology to offer temperature-based cycle tracking through a smartwatch for the first time,” said Dr. Raoul Scherwitzl, co-founder and co-CEO of Natural Cycles, in a statement. Shortly after sharing the news of the feature, Samsung announced it led a $7 million investment round in Natural Cycles. Other investors included Heartcore Capital, Headline, Bonnier Ventures and EQT Ventures. However, it’s worth pointing out that Apple cautions its own customers that the temperature-tracking features it introduced should not be used as birth control or to diagnose health conditions — even though it may track temperature changes that could be your first indication that other health problems may exist, like polycystic ovary syndrome or fibroids. Plus, Apple says, overnight temperature tracking can be impacted by other factors, like the sleep environment, and it notes that body temperature naturally fluctuates when you sleep. Instead, Apple says temperature tracking is used to provide improved period predictions and retrospective ovulation estimates only. Samsung doesn’t highlight those cautions in its own announcement, beyond a disclosure near the bottom, instead touting Natural Cycles’ ability to determine “each user’s unique fertility status.” Likely, a doctor would suggest this method on its own should not be used to determine fertility, we’d argue. But it could be useful in combination with other methods, including consistent a.m. basal temperature readings using a thermometer, other ovulation tests, and manually entered period tracker data. Today’s news shows Samsung is attempting to keep up with a market where Apple has been leading. But since it’s rushing to compete on this front, it chose to bring in a partner instead of creating an algorithm of its own in-house. It’s not the first time Samsung used a partnership to boost its Health app capabilities, either. The company previously announced a deal with Calm to upgrade the app’s Mindfulness section with content, for instance. Samsung says the new skin temperature–based cycle tracking capabilities will come to the Samsung Health app on the Galaxy Watch5 and Watch5 Pro within the second quarter. Thirty-two markets will support this feature, including in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S."
2024-02-17,Y Combinator wants 100 times more MRI scans,Biotech & Health,"Leveraging resources such as virtual data rooms and shared labs makes it easier for biotech startups to grow. This is good news: We need more companies attacking cancer from novel angles, including AI-enabled early detection. And who knows, maybe one of these will become a trillion-dollar company? — Anna Scaling early cancer detection Y Combinator’s newest request for startups (RFS) is well worth reading, and not just because it’s been a while since the incubator shared the ideas and categories its partners “would like to see more people working on.” As my colleague Sarah Perez noted, YC hadn’t updated its full list since 2018. Y Combinator puts out a new call for startups in areas like AI, spatial computing, climate tech and more Taken as a whole, YC’s RFS is a great way to sense the zeitgeist; the list includes AI of course, as well as climate tech, defense tech and more. But zooming in on individual requests is also a worthwhile exercise. One of the requests that captured my interest calls for “a way to end cancer.” Written by YC group partner Surbhi Sarna, a former medical device company CEO, it focuses on MRIs. “Since most cancers are now treatable if caught early enough,” she wrote, “this technology would dramatically reduce cancer deaths if rolled out widely and affordably.” My first thought was that MRI startups already exist. Just a few days earlier, New York–based Ezra raised a fresh round of $21 million — and we are talking about a team that TechCrunch first covered in 2018. It has competitors, too, such as Neko, backed by Spotify’s Daniel Ek, and Prenuvo, which has a $2,500 full-body scan that was promoted by Kim Kardashian. For Sarna, that price point is part of the problem, as it inherently limits scale, but it’s not the only one. “There is backlash from the medical community as MRIs also create incidental findings (or false positives) that cost our healthcare system valuable time and money to investigate.” The jury is still out on whether they are beneficial or individuals, let alone society. But YC still hopes startups can help. How to get into Y Combinator, according to YC’s Dalton Caldwell “For this to work, the world would need to scale up the number of MRI scans it does by at least 100x. Doing that will require innovations in the MRI hardware, the AI algorithms to interpret scans and reduce false positives, and the business models and consumer marketing to make it a viable business.” Of course, companies like Ezra are also hoping to do some of this in-house. In its latest pitch deck, the startup boasted it “leverages Al at every step of the screening process.” But if others can contribute from other angles, I can see why YC would be interested — I am. Co-working for biotech Shared lab spaces have been a game changer for biotech startups, Nature reported. Of course, co-working isn’t new, but co-working labs provide their customers with much more than office space, saving them both time and money. This reminded me of Startup Battlefield alum Parallel Health — its chief scientist officer Nathan Brown had mentioned shared labs in passing when we chatted at Disrupt. I noticed he had liked a repost of Nature’s article, so I asked him for his thoughts. He confirmed that the skincare startup he co-founded had been using BioLabs‘ shared facilities in Los Angeles, and he highlighted some of the benefits of this concept: BioLabs has enabled us to cost-effectively build a consumer biotech product. They make the laboratory infrastructure available to us without having to spend our entire seed round on capital expenses like DNA sequencing machines, laminar flow hoods, and lab-grade freezers. We also save immense amounts of time at BioLabs, because they manage all aspects of environmental health and safety as well as infrastructure management. Maybe most importantly, they create a thriving culture of innovation where startups can collaborate easily and learn from each other. While this may read as a local endorsement, startups don’t have to be based in California to leverage this trend. BioLabs itself is a franchise that has expanded to a dozen locations, and similar things could likely be said of many competing facilities around the world. However, a founder interviewed by Nature, Accure Health CEO Jessica Sang, shared a word of caution: Some labs are better equipped and wider-ranging than others. “If you’re thinking about starting a company, try to visit a few just to see which one is the best.” Virtual data rooms Virtual data rooms are another important resource for biotech startups. Calling them “the unsung hero of biotech financing,” and noting that they can also be helpful in business development talks, a16z published a guide on what biotech teams should and shouldn’t put in their data rooms. Apple and peers Sam Altman may not be raising trillions for AI chips after all, but it still got me thinking: How much money is a trillion with a T? When asked, Perplexity.ai surfaced an old CNBC article telling me that ​​$1 trillion in $100 bills would fill 4.5 Olympic-sized swimming pools — visually compelling, but not that helpful, sorry. Much more relevant is looking at a list of things that recently neared or passed the $1 billion threshold. Not national GDPs; we can just stick to tech and still have plenty of anchor points. The total amount invested in bitcoin. Dry powder available for climate tech. The liquidity gap for U.S. startups. And Nvidia’s market cap in May of last year. AI tailwinds haven’t faltered for the chip giant since then. Indeed, Nvidia’s market value briefly surpassed Amazon’s earlier this week when it reached $1.82 trillion. This says a lot about AI’s power and the leg up it gives companies that are best positioned to benefit from its rise. But it shouldn’t eclipse the wider story about the group of tech companies that have become known as “the Magnificent Seven” and their incredible cumulated market cap of some $13 trillion. As CNBC noted, “The last time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion.” Billion, with a small b. Fast-forward to today, and both aren’t that far from Apple’s $2.81 trillion market cap. Two-thirds of an Apple is much more telling than dollar-filled Olympic pools, isn’t it?"
2024-02-06,Stellar Sleep app gets initial funding to awaken root cause of chronic insomnia in users,Biotech & Health,"Stellar Sleep, a startup providing a first-digital tool for chronic insomnia management, raised $6 million in seed funding. In just the U.S. alone, poor sleeping habits not only impact the economy to hundreds of billions of dollars, but can also lead to health problems like heart disease and depression. There are plenty of apps and devices out there helping people track and monitor their sleep. Stellar Sleep co-founders George Wang and Edrei Chua say much of that is geared toward people with occasional sleep problems, not chronic insomnia, which is defined as having sleep problems three or more nights a week for over three months. Both Wang and Chua suffer from chronic insomnia and were told it would take six months to a year on a waitlist to be seen by a sleep clinician. Instead, they took matters into their own hands and learned about sleep therapy, a psychology-based methodology that addresses why the person has insomnia in the first place. Apple Fitness+ to add kickboxing workouts, sleep meditation and more “The first line of treatment should be psychological,” Chua said. “However, your doctor is choosing between giving the patient prescription drugs or putting them on a six-month long waiting list. Also, much of that medication is not indicated for long-term usage and is not going to fix the problem at its root cause.” Stellar Sleep’s mobile app taps into that method to help users break the cycle of those frequent nights awake. By helping users re-learn how to sleep well again, a clinical assessment of 500 users found Stellar Sleep to be 50% more effective than sleeping pills. Here’s how it works: Users download the app, create an account and complete an onboarding assessment so that Stellar Sleep understands the full picture behind the sleep issues. It combines several techniques, including cognitive behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and motivational interviewing. Tired and tested: Onera raises $32M to help clinicians conduct sleep studies in patients’ homes The app subscription is $60 a month and users can connect their wearables. Then Stellar Sleep builds a custom, interactive program that guides them daily to learn how to sleep well again. The program gets smarter as it goes to provide additional personalization based on users’ sleep statistics. The new funding represents the first institutional funding for Stellar Sleep. It was led by Initialized Capital with participation from Y Combinator, Lombardstreet Ventures, Switch Ventures, Moonfire Ventures, Scrum Ventures, 8vdx and Goodwater. Wang and Chua intend to use the new capital to increase the amount of content and curriculum offered on the app. They also want to increase the number of clinician partnerships to understand their practices and patients to then provide additional personalization of the user experience. “We’re focused on improving our product to make sure that we are able to help anyone coming in with chronic insomnia, no matter what the cause or where they are currently in their life,” Wang said. “We also aim to scale out this program to as many people as we can and ramping up the distribution side of things.” Eight Sleep CEO says his startup is more than a mattress company"
2023-05-16,Singapore’s Ora takes a vertically integrated approach to telehealth,Startups,"According to the founder of Singapore-based telehealth platform Ora, 90% of its patients are less than 39 years old and have not been treated for their conditions offline. That puts the onus on Ora to make sure its patients, mostly millennials who live in cities, have a good experience. Ora wants to perform with verticals focused on specific health issues, like women’s and men’s health and skincare. They also run an end-to-end platform that handles everything from consultations to prescription delivery and post-care. Today, Ora announced it has raised $10 million in Series A funding, which it says is the biggest telehealth Series A round in Southeast Asia. The investment was co-led by TNB Aura and Antler, with participation from Gobi Partners, Kairous Capital and GMA Ventures. This brings Ora’s total raised since its inception in 2020 to $17 million. Ora was founded by Elias Pour, the former CMO of Zalora, and says it has had uninterrupted >20% month-over-month growth since it launched last year. Pour told TechCrunch that while working at Zalora, he “saw a very clear trend from customers investing in looking good, driven by fashion buys that allowed them to express themselves, to feeling good, which is connected to physical appearance such as skin, hair, weight and overall well-being.” He started looking for segments that were underserved and found a major opportunity in healthcare. Ora founder and CEO Elias Pour. Image Credits: Ora Pour added that Southeast Asia has one of the highest out-of-pocket health expenditures globally, so there didn’t need to be a behavioral change in order to convince people to move to direct payments. “People are already used to paying out of pocket for their healthcare costs, suiting this category well for DTC.” Ora says it has delivered over 250,000 doctor consultations since its launch in 2021. It has an end-to-end model, meaning it covers consultations, pharmacy, medication delivery and post-purchase care. Ora monetizes with subscriptions, with subscriptions accounting for more than 70% of its revenue. Ora is vertically integrated, and currently operates three brands. The first, called Modules, is focused on online dermatology consultations and prescription skincare. The second, andSons, offers male health care, and the third, OVA, treats female reproductive healthcare. The platform primarily treats a young clientele. The company says that 90% of its patients are first to condition, under 38 years old and have never been treated before online. Younger patients demand flexibility and speed, which is why Ora’s telemedicine model is attractive to them. Pour said that one of the challenges healthcare providers face in Southeast Asia is the “large disconnect between the patient population,” which skews young, and the legacy experience of healthcare. He believes that over the next decade, about 80% of healthcare services will be brought online. “Today, men and women in their 20s and 30s living in capital cities represent 36% of the total population. It’s the fastest growing segment, forecasted to represent half of the population in most markets by 2030,” he said. Pour added that Ora is “establishing a strong relationship with them at this early stage, to earn their trust, remaining relevant to address the healthcare needs they will have as they age.” Pour said Ora differentiates from other telehealth players like Doctor Anywhere, Speedoc and Alodokter because it focuses on specific health issues. Ora is also combining prescription, OTC and strong consumer products to provide post-treatment service and clinical continuity. Ora’s new funding will be used to expand into new markets and bring its brands to more than 1,300 retail stores. In a statement, TNB Aura founding partner Charles Wong said, “[Ora’s] combined focus on specialized, and often taboo, healthcare verticals as well as a direct-to-patient approach has led the team to clearly differentiate itself while delivering market-leading unit economics that meet the tailored needs of patients across the full value chain.” Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?"
2023-05-08,Acapela lets anyone back up their own voice for free in minutes — just in case,AI,"Synthetic speech can be a fearful object these days when paired with deepfakes and other AI deceptions, but it’s also an indispensable tool for anyone who can no longer speak on their own. Acapela Group has these folks squarely in mind with its new “my own voice” service, which lets anyone train an AI voice profile for free. Acapela has been in the text-to-speech space for around 25 years and was recently acquired by tech accessibility giant Tobii Dynavox, though they still operate independently. Like many industries, accessibility has been heavily influenced by the advent of consumer-scale machine learning processes. Seven or 8 years ago, Acapela co-founder Remy Cadic recalls, it was not just tedious to customize a synthetic voice for yourself, but the results weren’t particularly good. “It was very time consuming — the patient had to train for 8 hours. Now we can bank a voice with just 50 sentences recorded; it takes about 10 minutes and the voice is ready the next day,” he said. “There’s definitely a revolution going on with neural text-to-speech techniques.” Having a speech generator that uses one’s own voice is certainly something a growing number of people can appreciate — choosing from a list is a bit dehumanizing. Many have voices they would rather use, but it wasn’t until recently that it was an option. They weren’t kidding about how quick and easy it is: I went through the new “my own voice” process, and it really was just 50 short sentences, drawn from a (random, it seemed) corpus of novels, recipe books, and articles. The recording interface was simple and easy to navigate, and sure enough, a day or so later my voice was ready to use. The quality is fine — not uncanny like some models out there can be, but clearly my own voice (as advertised) and able to handle any sentence I threw at it in the demo page. Now that it’s there, if I ever need it I can go and download it for a fee to use on any compatible speech-generation system. Obviously this includes Tobii Dynavox’s TD Talk and devices; the company just released a new one last week, in fact — these things are getting pretty sleek. Delaina tests out the new Tobii Dynavox device. Image Credits: Acapela Group And that’s the real point of all this — it’s not a technical demonstration of the power of neural voice tech or a demo that lets anyone feed it a celebrity voice to clone. It’s a tool made specifically for people who until recently may have had no options or at best a difficult, complex process if they wanted to preserve their voice. Many facing degenerative conditions, cancer, or certain procedures know that within a few months or years they may not be able to speak well or at all anymore. Making the process of banking their voice as easy as possible is a service many will appreciate. “One big advantage is we also customize for children — we’ve made the recording script easier to read, and tuned the system to make the quality of children’s synthetic voices better. We were the first in the world to do that, and we’re still going in this direction,” said Cadic. Being able to record and re-record or artificially age the banked voice is a new and challenging capability, but one that seems to be getting results: The compatibility with offline devices that don’t have the latest neural processing chip is a key differentiator as well. “There are online solutions where it’s easy to create a voice, but it’s only available via the cloud, and that’s just not practical,” he said. Incidentally, while the 50-sentence thing is great for folks who can still read and speak, a voice can also be trained on voice recordings from people who have since lost that ability — it just isn’t quite so simple. The company has also found that diversity and thoughtfulness in the training process is as important as in other AI applications. Cadic pointed out that an issue with some super-fast training techniques is that “it will pretty much just try to find the speaker in the training material that’s closest to the user. But if there isn’t a speaker in the training close to the original voice, it just won’t sound like it.” Acapela product manager Nicolas Mazars added that, like many AI problems with their root in insufficient training data, this one is not evenly distributed: “That process works well for the average 50-year-old white guy, but not if you’re an African-American man, or you don’t speak English well. We work in 23 languages, and have many users who have disabilities. We try to rely on user feedback and develop something for them, by them.” The recording and banking process is free; you can sign up for an account here and train your own synthetic voice in minutes. You only pay if you want to download and install it on a device."
2020-06-09,DNAnexus raises $100M for a cloud-based analytics platform aimed at genomics and other clinical big data,Biotech & Health,"DNAnexus, which provides a cloud platform for governments, universities, doctors and pharmaceutical companies to tap into DNA and other clinical data sets and collaborate on scientific research projects, is today announcing a big step ahead in its efforts to grow its reach and purpose. The 10-year-old startup, originally spun out of Stanford’s school of medicine, has raised $100 million in funding. The round, technically a Series G, is being co-led by Perceptive Advisors and Northpond Ventures (both specialist science and biotech investors), with participation also from previous backers GV (which has been around since almost the beginning), Foresite Capital, TPG Capital and First Round Capital. DNAnexus is also picking up a new strategic backer in this round: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals — one of several companies currently working on antibody therapies for COVID-19 recovery. Indeed, the idea will be to use the funding to continue building out that platform and the use cases around it, specifically as research has boomed around the current coronavirus global health pandemic. “This financing drives advancement of our data science technologies benefiting our rapidly growing customer base,” said Richard Daly, chief executive officer at DNAnexus, in a statement. “The next wave of biomedical insights and treatments will be driven by large-scale clinical, multi-omics, and real-world data resulting from cross-institutional collaborations. Our customers have continued to grow during the current COVID-19 epidemic using the virtual cloud workspace we provide. The trend toward cloud-based data analysis and collaboration is accelerating, and we are at the right place at the right time to future-proof and serve our customers.” The funding is the biggest-ever round raised by DNAnexus, which prior to this had raised about $127 million with other investors, including Microsoft and Felicis, according to PitchBook data. It’s not disclosing a valuation, but we’re asking. As some markers of where it’s sitting as a business, however, a spokesperson says that the platform is used by eight of the top 10 clinical diagnostics companies and seven of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, which use 10 million core processing hours each month and store 28 petabytes of data, a figure that has grown 70% annually in the last four years. It has also inked some very notable partners. They include Regeneron Genetics Centre, which is using the DNAnexus interface to query data from the UK Biobank — an academic-run data trove based on genomic and clinical data from some 500,000 volunteer participants. And it is working with government groups like the Food and Drug Administration to help it run a database it uses to collaborate and work with other organizations to help track genomic variation, an essential component of DNA-based medical research. It’s been a rocky road for DNA and how it’s viewed by consumers in recent years. Once held up as a kind of Rosetta Stone to answer all the inscrutable questions we’ve ever had about how our bodies work, where we come from and who really did it, companies that offer DNA data to average people have more recently been in the spotlight over questions of ethics and data privacy. As a business, it also seems like some of the more prominent names in the space have found interest in the area waning. DNAnexus sits adjacent but also quite separate from those currents. The company definitely got its start around the time that others like 23andMe were popularising the idea of democratising DNA information, but it has always had its roots in the more arcane but also more serious side of the DNA business and its challenges: how best to wrangle and query what are essentially very large and unwieldy datasets in order to glean actionable insights. It’s also more than just about DNA, working with other large and often unstructured clinical data sets to help others in the field use the data more intelligently and with the correct privacy compliance in place (which is another kind of “intelligent” use of data), part of a bigger trend to develop medicines that are more attuned to individuals rather than one-size-fits-all solutions that often miss the mark, particularly in complex pathology, such as cancer care. Tapping into AI to build out therapies, it is one of the more cutting-edge, but also lucrative, areas in medicine today. “The Precision Medicine market is poised to exceed $119 billion by 2026. Many pharmaceutical companies and medical centers are adopting strategies rooted in human genetics because evidence shows that the odds of a drug’s clinical success doubles if associated with specific biomarkers,” said Michael Rubin, MD, PhD, founder and CEO of Northpond Ventures, in a statement. “Providing the ecosystem with a tool to analyze and gain insights from all these massive datasets is a difficult undertaking. DNAnexus has a proven product that scales.”"
2024-06-12,Foresite Capital raises $900M sixth fund for investing in life sciences companies,Venture,"Venture fundraising has been a slog over the last few years, even for firms with a strong track record. That’s Foresite Capital’s experience. Despite having 47 IPOs, 28 M&As and 58 FDA-approved drugs under its belt, the 13-year-old multi-stage healthcare and life sciences firm took two years to raise its sixth fund. “Almost all of our LPs in fund five renewed in fund six. They just renewed with 30% less capital,” Jim Tananbaum, Foresite’s CEO and founder, told TechCrunch. “We had a bit of a hole to plug.” The San Francisco-based firm was set on making sure its sixth vehicle wasn’t significantly smaller than its fifth fund, which totaled $969 million, consisting of a $775 million core fund and a $194 million companion opportunities fund. Foresite hired Hadi Tabbaa to bridge the funding gap and lead the firm’s widespread investment relations effort. Tabbaa, previously with B Capital and Coatue Management, has helped the firm bring in new LPs, including family offices from Asia and the Middle East. On Wednesday, Foresite announced that it closed its sixth fund with $900 million. The firm began investing from fund six nearly two years ago and backed a number of interesting companies over that period. Foresite Capital made a big splash in April when its accelerator, Foresite Labs, along with ARCH Venture Partners, invested $1 billion to incubate Xaira, a new AI drug discovery startup. Tananbaum also highlighted the firm’s recent participation in the $135 million Series A of Latigo Bio, a clinical-stage biotech company testing a non-opioid pain treatment. Last summer, Foresite co-led a $115 million Series F into CG Oncology, a drug discovery company that had a successful IPO listing in January. Foresite intends to back about 20 companies from its sixth fund, writing checks from a couple of million up to $75 million. “Over a decade ago, we named the firm Foresite because we thought we had an idea of where healthcare was headed,” Tananbaum said. “We felt that it was going to be a combination of genomics and artificial intelligence that would lead to the ability to distribute care individually.” These are still big areas of focus for the firm."
2023-12-11,"After year-long search, Strava appoints YouTube exec Michael Martin as new CEO",Biotech & Health,"Strava has finally announced who its next CEO will be, almost a year after confirming that co-founder Michael Horvath was leaving the hotseat for a second time. Michael Martin will start his new role at Strava on January 2, 2024, leaving his current role as general manager at YouTube’s shopping unit. Martin previously served in technology roles at Nike, NBCUniversal Media and Disney. Horvath co-founded Strava alongside Mark Gainey back in 2009, with Gainey initially serving as CEO before passing the reins to Horvath, who led the company until 2013 when he left for family reasons. Gainey then became CEO until 2017, when he was replaced by Instagram executive James Quarles — then Horvath returned as CEO in 2019, with Gainey in tow as executive chairman. When he revealed last year that he would leaving for a second time, Horvath simply said that he felt the company needed someone different to spearhead the next phase of its growth. “As co-founder and CEO, it’s only part of my job to ensure we are picking the right path to that destination,” he said at the time. “The other part of it is to ensure we always recruit and support the right leaders for the right times.” Strava’s new CEO Michael Martin. Image Credits: Strava Growing pains The 14-year-old company has emerged as the de facto activity-tracking platform for millions, allowing users to record and share all their rides and runs with friends around the world. Strava saw significant growth through the global pandemic, leading to its $110 million Series F round of funding in late 2020, since when it says it has grown from 70 million members to north of 120 million today. However, like all VC-backed companies, the time is fast coming when Strava needs to realize some sort of return for its investors, be that a sale to a bigger company or an IPO. Either outcome requires Strava to be in as strong a position as possible, which is why it has been trying to bolster its platform over the past year — it acquired 3D mapping platform Fatmap in January, which now provides 3D video flyovers of users’ GPS routes directly inside the Strava app. And last week, Strava went all-in on the social network concept when it launched in-app messaging, designed to encourage users to do all their organizing within Strava itself. But in amongst all that, Strava introduced a confusing and inconsistent pricing upgrade, with a typical U.S. customer seeing their annual subscription jump from $60 to $80 a month, and the monthly fee rising from $8 to $12 — a substantial 50% hike, one that caused consternation in the Strava community. So on the outside, it seems that Strava has been struggling to capitalize on its recent growth even though it has sought ways to make more money from its users. And this, perhaps, is where Martin enters the fray — at YouTube he is focused on helping creators “build and diversify their businesses through commerce,” so it’s not all the inconceivable that Strava could be looking to diversify its revenue beyond selling subscriptions or data and insights. The free version of Strava is sufficient for most people, so figuring out ways to make money from that contingent, be it advertising, affiliate partnerships, or some other means, could be the way forward under the new leadership. When Martin joins in early January, he will also take up a seat on the board alongside the likes of Gainey and Spotify exec Gustav Gyllenhammar. Horvath will also apparently stay on for the time being as an “executive advisor to the CEO.” “I am incredibly proud of what the Strava team has accomplished, especially during the past four years during which we built our subscription with the needs of our community in mind and strengthened our foundation for future growth,” said Horvath. “In Michael Martin, I am confident we found a leader I can pass the baton to and who can build Strava’s momentum even further. I look forward to supporting him as executive advisor to the CEO.”"
2023-09-11,Scala Biodesign makes it easy to re-engineer proteins one molecule at a time – or 50,Biotech & Health,"There’s a gold rush on in biotech as AI and other tools are used to find new drugs and treatments. With $5.5 million in new funding, Scala Biodesign is focusing these methods on a related problem: making existing or promising drugs more practical by tweaking them one (or more) molecule at at time. The founders spun the company out of research done at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Tel Aviv around predicting the 3D structure and behavior of proteins. AlphaFold and RoseTTAfold blew the doors off the field in recent years, and by combining their capabilities with other data, Scala’s founders say they can accelerate one of the slowest aspects of engineering therapeutic molecules. There are many potential drugs out there that perform some useful function, but are in other ways unsuitable for mass manufacturing or distribution — for instance, they break up at room temperature, or when exposed to a body’s natural chemical environment. A more robust version might involve swapping out one small piece of the molecule… but which piece, and what do you swap in? “Protein development process is very complex, and even in large companies it’s largely trial and error,” said CEO and co-founder Ravit Netzer. “Scientists engineer them by some flavor of random mutagenesis. But now that we know the structures of these proteins, it’s clear that randomly changing things is not really an option.” As an example: A small protein that’s a chain of 100 amino acids, with 20 options for each of those 100 positions, has so many possibilities to test that you could do so until the sun burned out and still not exhaust them. And indeed, many such attempts to randomly hit on an improvement either take a long time to get results or simply fail and cost millions. Scala co-founders Ravit Netzer (left) and Adi Goldenzweig. It’s a bit like changing one word of a paragraph to a random one from the dictionary and hoping it gets your point across better, when what you need is a thesaurus. (Trust a writer to come up with a tortured metaphor like this one.) Scala has combined protein structure prediction with clinical data and observations of naturally occurring proteins to produce a system that can home in on changes that accomplish a given outcome. Improving stability, amplifying effect, easing manufacture, there are plenty of ways that almost-there proteins can graduate to useful and effective levels. It’s all computational — no wet lab — and they ultimately provide a small number of high confidence sequences, one of which they are sure will at least move things in the right direction. The malaria vaccine candidate, before and after modification. As a real-world example, one lab was working on a naturally occurring protein that works as a malaria vaccine. The problem is that it is sensitive to temperature, and likely wouldn’t survive transport or storage. “They knew they had a problem with thermal stability. They gave one input and got three outputs, went with the best one, and it’s now in clinical trials,” said CTO and co-founder Adi Goldenzweig. “Ideally we would provide one option and be 100% confident, but we’re not there yet. But people often go through tens of thousands.” They added that this is not simply switching one amino acid for another, but that in larger proteins they may be swapping in dozens at at time. “You won’t find anybody doing that, over 50 mutations in one shot,” Goldenzweig pointed out. “I think we have a very unique range and depth of validation — a track record of successful protein design in very diverse applications. Antibodies, enzymes you name it,” said Netzer. “We have shown time and again that you can actually design major improvements to proteins — we want to prove this can be done at scale, not just as a PhD project.” (Hence the company’s name.) Currently the company is working with some unnamed pharmaceutical companies and labs, and remaining flexible as far as the licensing and business model goes. Providing and proving out the service is the priority, not establishing their own biological IP, though they don’t rule that out for the future. “As a seed company we can’t do everything, so we’re focusing on working with companies, showing them our tech. The way to work with them is to not complicate things,” Netzer explained. The company’s $5.5 million seed funding round, led by TLV partners, is their first.

2023-08-30,QuantHealth brings its AI-informed clinical drug trials to the US with $15M round,Startups,"Biotech, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies all hope AI will streamline drug development and make it more efficient, and 38% have already adopted the technology, according to Deloitte. QuantHealth aims to take part with a model that predicts risks and outcomes for clinical trials. The company’s AI-powered platform for drug discovery claims to reduce potential risks, optimize clinical trials and help identify how patients in a clinical trial would respond to treatment. The Tel Aviv-based startup said Wednesday it had raised a $15 million Series A funding round, which brings its total raised to $20 million. “With over 30 years of collective experience in life science and drug development, it was clear to us that the decreasing success rates of clinical trials were becoming untenable for the industry,” co-founder and CEO of QuantHealth Orr Inbar told TechCrunch. Also citing Deloitte, he noted that returns on investment have declined to historic lows. The differentiator claimed by QuantHealth’s platform is one of the most extensive integrated datasets, which Inbar described as covering over 350 million patients and more than 700,000 biomedical graphs and clinical trials. The company says the resulting model can predict clinical trial outcomes with 86% accuracy on the binary endpoint metric. That means the company predicts success or failure for a trial’s primary endpoint (or any other endpoint) 86% of the time. More than 90% of traditionally planned clinical trials fail to make it to market due to lack of efficacy and safety, Inbar explained. “Some drugs just shouldn’t go to trial, and for many that should, the trials are poorly designed,” Inbar said. “This causes the trials to take longer, cost more and fail more often.” In a recent case study, QuantHealth helped a client design their phase 2 trial in acute respiratory distress syndrome. “By simulating thousands of protocol variations, we were able to make minor amendments to their protocol that had far-reaching consequences — increasing the target population by 4.5x, reducing study duration by 11 months, reducing the number of participants required by 251, all while improving the likelihood of success of the primary endpoint by 16.5%,” Inbar said. Founded in 2020, QuantHealth, which has been commercially active for the last two years, works with pharma, biotechs and clinical research organizations, supporting their programs on an ongoing basis, as well as regulators in the U.S. and Europe. In June, QuantHealth announced its U.S. expansion with executive appointments, including David Dornstreich as chief commercial officer and co-founder Arnon Horev as chief strategy and operations officer. The CEO said the outfit has 25 employees in Israel and the U.S., aiming to grow to 40 by next year. Bertelsmann Investment and Pitango HealthTech co-led the Series A funding. Existing backers Shoni Top Ventures, Nina Capital and Nova Capital also joined in the latest round. The new capital will enable the startup to support clinical development teams with its flagship trial design solution and expand its platform for preclinical and drug discovery functions, as well as expand its commercial team and operations."
2023-08-10,Basys.ai grabs $2.4M for its prior authorization tech powered by Mayo Clinic’s data,Biotech & Health,"Prior authorization, a fancy term for your doctor needing to gain approval from your health insurance company before doing a medical procedure, has typically been a heavily manual process involving lots of steps, reviews and people having to work together. Seeking approval from the insurance company is meant to prevent unnecessary procedures and keep healthcare costs down; however, the lengthy process of prior authorization often leads to delayed or even abandoned care. And the administrative costs associated account for between 20% and 34% of U.S. healthcare expenditures. In an effort to fix this, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposal in February designed to address how burdensome prior authorization is on the healthcare system, calling for this process to join the digital world. Some experts have said the CMS proposal paves the way for technology companies to introduce their solutions that will ultimately strengthen the way healthcare data is used. One new company taking advantage is Basys.ai, which helps health plans and health systems adopt value-based care, starting with prior authorization. It was founded in early 2022 by Amber Nigam and Jie Sun, who met while in Harvard’s health data science program. Basys combines generative AI and deep learning to power its “engine,” which can automate up to 90% of the prior authorization requests for drugs and procedures at high accuracy, Nigam told TechCrunch. The platform also doesn’t require sensitive data from insurance companies or doctors, thus reducing the typical integration time from up to a year down to weeks. “The engine is trained on extensive Joslin Diabetes Center and Mayo Clinic’s longitudinal data of more than 10 million patients,” Nigam said. “This translates to flattening the cost curve for patients and reducing administrative burden by leveraging AI.” In addition, by automating the encoding of payer policies, Basys can more quickly plot timelines with health plans at a rate of up to nine months faster than most of its competitors, of which Nigam said included companies like Cohere Health. The company makes its commercial launch today, buoyed by $2.4 million pre-seed funding. Nina Capital led the round and was joined by a group of investors, including Eli Lilly (Lilly Ventures), Mayo Clinic, Two Lanterns Venture Partners, Asset Management Ventures and Chaac Ventures. Basys initially began selling to providers and had been bringing in revenue, but has since pivoted its business model to selling to health insurance companies. It is now initiating pilots with two large payers in Massachusetts and Minnesota, Nigam said. The company is also working on capturing patient outcomes through reducing readmission rates and determining if the progression of the patient’s disease has stopped or slowed down. “We also make sure we have a lot of information about the patients,” Nigam said. “Sometimes when you make decisions, it is not entirely based on one or two attributes; it’s based on hundreds or thousands of attributes along with the understanding of the insurance company’s policies. Once you match these policies with the patient information, then resolving a prior authorization request is more nuanced.” Clinical pathways are the currency of health tech"
2024-06-25,H Venture Partners launches venture studio focused on microbiome tech,Biotech & Health,"H Venture Partners is launching a venture studio that will focus on sourcing microbiome technologies and materials that can be commercialized and turned into startups. The firm said on Friday that it will source talent who can solve health problems like depression, cancer, eczema and neurodegenerative diseases. This expansion is in part funded by H Partner’s Fund II, which just announced a $10 million investment from the state of Ohio. Fund II is now oversubscribed with $24 million in total funding. “We are tackling the top two threats to humanity,” Elizabeth Edwards, the firm’s founder and managing partner, told TechCrunch. “Our primary focus is preventing antibiotic resistance and our secondary focus is reversing climate change and eliminating petrol-based plastics.” Edwards hopes to invest in at least 13 early-stage companies, with check sizes ranging from $500,000 to $1 million. The firm’s portfolio already includes companies like Felix Health and Parsley Health, and it has more than $40 million in assets under management. So far, companies with at least one woman founder have raised more than $2 billion in funding in the pharma and bio sector, according to PitchBook; last year, such groups raised $5.4 billion out of around the $18.4 billion that was invested in the sector altogether. H Venture Partners closes $10M debut fund targeting science-based brands Edwards founded H Ventures in 2017 and the firm remains female-founded, owned, and operated. The firm’s goal is to help support more marginalized founders, and it aims to continue doing that at a broader scale with this new venture studio and new fund. Currently, H Ventures invests more than 90% of its portfolio into marginalized founders, helping to bring more women and people of color to the forefront of biological sciences at a time when less than 2% of all venture funding goes to such groups. “If you think that investing in women is a bad idea, you’re missing half of the best opportunities in the world,” Edwards said, adding that the firm believes in “excellence through inclusion.”"
2024-05-16,Google expands hands-free and eyes-free interfaces on Android,Apps,"As part of 2024’s Accessibility Awareness Day, Google is showing off some updates to Android that should be useful to folks with mobility or vision impairments. Project Gameface allows gamers to use their faces to move the cursor and perform common click-like actions on desktop, and now it’s coming to Android. The project lets people with limited mobility use facial movements, like raising an eyebrow, moving their mouth or turning their head, to activate a variety of functions. There’s basic stuff like a virtual cursor, but also gestures where, for instance, you can define the beginning and end of a swipe by opening your mouth, moving your head, then closing your mouth. It’s customizable to a person’s abilities, and Google researchers are working with Incluzza in India to test and improve the tool. Certainly for many people, the ability to simply and easily play many of the thousands of games (well, millions probably, but thousands of good ones) on Android will be more than welcome. There’s a great video here that shows the product in action and being customized; Jeeja there in the preview image talks about changing how much she needs to move her head to active the gesture. That kind of granular adjustment is as important as someone able to set the sensitivity of your mouse or trackpad. Another feature for folks who can’t easily operate a keyboard, on-screen or physical: a new non-text “look to speak” mode that lets people choose and send emojis either on their own or as representatives for a phrase or action. You can also add your own photos, so someone could have common phrases and emoji on speed dial and also pictures of commonly used contacts attached to photos of them, all accessible with a few glances. For people with vision impairments, there are a variety of tools out there (of varying effectiveness, no doubt) that let a user identify things the phone’s camera sees. The use cases are countless, so sometimes it’s best to start with something simple, like finding an empty chair, or recognizing the person’s keychain and pointing it out. Image Credits: Google Users will be able to add custom object or location recognition so the instant description function will give them what they need and not just a list of generic objects like “a mug and a plate on a table.” Which mug?! Apple also showed off some accessibility features yesterday, and Microsoft has a few as well. Take a minute to peruse these projects, which seldom get the main-stage treatment (though Gameface did) but are of major importance to those for whom they are designed.

2023-07-05,"EGYM, the Munich-based smart fitness startup, raises $225M from Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners",Biotech & Health,"The technology industry at large might not be in the best of health at the moment, but health and fitness startups appear to be alive and well. EGYM, the Munich-based “smart workout solution” business, has agreed to a monster equity investment of €207 million ($225 million) on the back of a very strong year of growth, led by the investment firm started by Jared Kushner. The company’s business includes both a line of connected hardware (its own gym equipment); software (apps and diagnostics to measure and optimize how people work out on EGYM’s and other connected fitness equipment); a corporate health network operation called Wellpass with more than 2.5 million users; and a mission: to improve healthcare outcomes by focusing on “the shared economy of a gym,” in the words of CEO and co-founder Philipp Roesch-Schlanderer. “Ninety-nine percent of the market is repair versus prevention,” he said of the approach to healthcare and its focus on chronic conditions treated with medicine and related therapies, an approach that he believes would be less likely, and less expensive, if people exercised and treated their bodies better. “We want to shift that.” You can argue that this is a gross over-simplification of the state of global healthcare market today, but you might argue less with EGYM’s numbers. The business brought in $130 million in revenues in 2022, growing 70% year-over-year. Wellpass, a big focus for the company going forward, grew 100% in the same period. En route to a future IPO, it expects to double down on newer markets like the U.S. and become profitable while doubling overall revenues to $260 million in 2023. And in a difficult year for fundraising when investors’ attention seems mostly focused on AI startups, EGYM’s round is one of the biggest to come out of Europe. All the more interesting, then, when you consider the lead investor. Affinity Partners — the Saudi-backed, Florida-based investment firm founded by the son-in-law and close confidante of former U.S. President Donald Trump — is leading the round, with previous backers Mayfair Equity Partners and Bayern Kapital also participating. This is a Series F, and EGYM said that roughly half of it, €107 million, will “flow immediately” with the remaining €100 million on the table for future use. The first tranche is coming at a post-money valuation of €600 million. Based on the company’s growth rate — which is currently at a rate of 70% year-over-year for the full business — Roesch-Schlanderer said that when the second tranche is drawn down, it will likely be at a higher valuation. EGYM’s current flush period comes after nearly 14 years in business — it was founded in 2010 — and nearly going bust during COVID when all gym activity grounded to a halt. And the idea had a very classic beginning: it came to Roesch-Schlanderer to solve his own problem; specifically, his own failings when it came to exercise. “It all started with me being an unsuccessful gym goer,” he said in an interview, explaining that typically while people are shown how to use the array of machines at their gyms, they’re largely left to their own devices after that. “I tried to understand why I and so many others fail to work well there.” Roesch-Schlanderer, who studied tech entrepreneurship and management at university, predictably saw a business opportunity in that question — one that could be answered with technology. “I realized that those who work well either have trainers or themselves backgrounds in exercise science,” he said. “So we decided that we could make the gym work if we provided an AI-based trainer to every user.” And that is, in effect, what the company’s longer-term goal has been. The business started very much focused around its own hardware coupled with basic usage measurements based on people exercising on EGYM’s own equipment. Over time, the company has been slowly incorporating more sophisticated tech into the mix, and making the software work with other equipment. The AI-based personal trainer he speaks of has yet to be rolled out, although there has been more machine learning incorporated into the product on the road to more personalization. “We think in the next two years we will perfect this,” Roesch-Schlanderer said of the AI service. That has also changed the makeup of the business: These days the hardware/gym equipment part of the business “remains an incredibly important piece” of the EGYM business, but it also now accounts for only 25% of the company’s revenues. At a time when consumer-focused fitness businesses have hit a number of bumps — Peloton and its 2 million bike recall in May being the most recent hiccup — EGYM interestingly has been set up as a B2B operation: gyms of all sizes, rather than individual users, have always been its target customers and as of today, there are some 16,000 using EGYM’s products. In recent years, with the launch and growth of Wellpass, that has extended to building business relationships with corporates and others that offer their employees health and wellness benefits, with some 11,500 of those using EGYM products also part of the Wellpass network. (On that note, Roesch-Schlanderer said that it’s not looking at Affinity as a strategic investor: There have been no conversations so far to bring on The Trump Organization or its various resort properties as customers.) While fundraising has been on the rocks overall in the tech sector in the last year, one of the bright spots it seems has been health, and specifically companies building services on the theme of preventative care, using technology to improve on the traditional way of doing things. Just earlier today, Neko Health — co-founded by Spotify’s Daniel Ek — announced a $65 million round for its full-body AI scan with a promise/amibition of finding issues and optimizing care before potential issues become health problems. Last week, Augmedics raised more than $80 million for a new take on spinal surgery that aims to be less invasive and more accurate thanks to AR and AI. We’ve also seen a wave of insure-tech startups that are trying to tap into this concept by providing corporate customers wellness and fitness services to help people get healthy and avoid the more costly medical routes they end up taking when they are not. “EGYM serves the large and rapidly growing global fitness and healthcare markets with a differentiated technology-centric model,” said Asad Naqvi, a partner at Affinity Partners, in a statement. “We don’t often come across companies with revenues in the triple-digit millions that are close to doubling in size year-over-year. In EGYM, we are backing an incredible team with a long track record of execution and success, and we look forward to supporting the company on its path to an IPO.”"
2022-12-13,"Komodo Health, once tipped for a looming IPO, has cut staff as CFO departs",Startups,"Komodo Health, a healthcare enterprise in the business of making data-driven maps, has laid off 9% of staff, or 78 people, according to sources. The personnel change comes about a month after the company internally announced that its CFO would be leaving at the end of the year for personal reasons, and just months after the Tiger Global–backed company was rumored to be going public. But, as IPO season continues to be frigid, the not-yet-profitable business has clearly opted to make cuts ahead of any 2023 movement. Sources say the restructuring could be the company’s attempt to look more profitable ahead of an anticipated public market debut. TechCrunch reached out to Komodo Health for comment but did not yet hear back at time of publication. The company did, however, confirm the layoffs in a LinkedIn post. Co-founders Arif Nathoo and Web Sun wrote a memo to staff, obtained by TechCrunch, which describes the layoffs as part of a broader restructuring as the world changes “again.” “We believe that this is the beginning of a change that may last for many more months, if not years,” the co-founders wrote in the email, sent to all full-time employees. “We have always prided ourselves on running a capital efficient business, and today we’re taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned for the current world around us.” Axios last reported that Komodo’s ARR, as of March, was around $150 million; investors, meanwhile, valued the company at $3.3 billion during its last funding round, a $220 million Series E announced in March 2021. After the email was sent, Komodo Health’s co-founders also held a meeting with remaining employees, adding that the company has closed a structured equity infusion from Dragoneer and Coatue for around $200 million, sources said. The co-founders also stressed that the layoff was meant be “one and done.” It is unclear whether this round was raised at the same valuation of its March 2021 round. Komodo Health is joining a number of late-stage companies that have announced workforce reductions in the final innings of the year, including Stripe, Plaid and Airtable. It conducted a previous round of layoffs in April 2020, just months after raising a $50 million round from Andreessen Horowitz.

2024-03-28,"YC-backed Pelago, a virtual clinic for addiction treatment, raises $58M Series C",Biotech & Health,"Pelago, Y Combinator-backed telehealth company that uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help treat people with tobacco, alcohol and opioid addictions, said Thursday it had raised a $58 million Series C round. The recent funding, which brings its total raised to $151 million since being founded in 2017, comes two and a half years after Pelago, formerly known as Quit Genius, closed a Series B of $64 million amid the COVID pandemic. Yusuf Sherwani, co-founder and CEO of Pelago, told TechCrunch that the company plans to use the proceeds to bring on more users, advance its clinical research efforts, and develop further products. Most recently, the company expanded its offering to include virtual therapy sessions and services for adolescents across its footprint. The virtual clinic’s medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders is available across 50 states for adults and teens. It treats across all acuity levels along with co-occurring mental health conditions. Since its Series B, Pelago has experienced an impressive 11x revenue surge and claims to have 100% client retention. The company did not provide the baseline of its revenue. Its full-time headcount has also tripled from 50 in 2021 to 150, demonstrating its rapid expansion, Sherwani said. Sherwani, Maroof Ahmed (COO), and Sarim Siddiqui (head of product) all met at medical school before going on to found Pelago. The impetus for starting the company came after the trio witnessed the devastating effects of smoking and other addictions: as the company explains, substance addiction and abuse exist on a spectrum, with every individual’s experience and situation needing nuanced approaches, but straightforward medicalized approaches are often not a silver bullet. CBT and longer-term approach that comes with it have been shown to be effective in helping many figure out how to identify and work on issues. Combining this knowledge with advances in technology, and growing acceptance for telehealth solutions, the co-founders created a solution platform, Pelago. The company does not sell directly to consumers. Instead, it partners with employers and healthcare benefit providers, who in turn provide it as a service, respectively to employees or health plan members when they are actively seeking treatment for themselves (or their families if they are covered in the plans). The CBT is currently focused around substance abuse, specifically alcohol, tobacco and opioids. Pelago says its remote CBT program includes a physician-led care team of physicians, nurses, counselors, and coaches. The company diagnoses each user and develops a personalized care plan for users. Pelago members have regular sessions with virtual care teams in the app, consisting of health coaches or licensed drug and alcohol counselors. Its in-app telehealth capabilities include video and audio calling and a direct-to-therapist chat interface. Therapists also can request structured wellness checks for their members.It also offers PelagoRx, a medication-assisted treatment (MAT) through confidential prescriptions Currently, Pelago has more than 100 enterprise customers across a variety of industries — mining, manufacturing, technology, construction, education, and healthcare among them. According to the company’s website, its registered users were more than 750,000 as of August 2023. TechCrunch reported that the outfit had around 300,000 registered users in May 2018. Image Credits: Pelago founders/ Pelago “Pelago offers its integrated substance use management to employer and health plan populations, with specialized treatment for tobacco, alcohol, and opioid use disorders along with support for adolescents,” the company CEO told TechCrunch in an interview. Apart from the fact that medical approaches can be hit and miss, Sherwani said, they can also be very expensive. According to a survey, around 67% of adults in the U.S. who struggle with an alcohol or illicit drug use disorder remain in the workforce. But the cost of treating substance use disorders for each individual enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance can be very expensive, with an average of a minimum of $15,640 annually. Last year, Pelago published an internal study that claimed using its service reduced medical claims by $9,367 annually per participant compared to a control group. According to the CEO, its users are five times more likely to quit smoking in one year with the Pelago platform than other programs. In addition to its virtual therapy interface, the company is investing in bringing more tech to bear on its business. For example, it has introduced an AI-powered assistant, Pelago Chart, for clinical teams to take notes more automatically. Existing backer Atomico, which doubled down on the Series C investment on the back of Pelago’s growth, led the funding, with participation from other previous investors like Kinnevik AB, Octopus Ventures and Y Combinator. New investors Eight Roads and GreyMatter Capital also participated in the round. https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/how-one-founder-saw-the-value-of-remote-care-for-addiction-treatment-long-before-the-pandemic/ Quit Genius raises $11M Series A to expand into opioid, alcohol addiction treatment"
2024-05-30,Valar Labs debuts AI-powered cancer care prediction tool and secures $22M,Biotech & Health,"Putting AI to work in the healthcare industry is a tricky business; it’s even more so in oncology, where the stakes are especially high. Biotech startup Valar Labs is aiming high but starting small with a tool that accurately predicts certain treatment outcomes, potentially saving precious time for patients. It has raised $22 million to expand to new cancers and therapies. Every cancer is different, but many have established best practices honed over years of testing. Sometimes, however, that means going through months of a given treatment regimen in order to find out whether it works. Bladder cancer is one of these, Valar’s co-founders explained to TechCrunch. A common first treatment recommended by oncologists, called BCG therapy, has about a coin-flip’s chance of working — which is actually pretty good! But wouldn’t it be nice to not have to flip that coin to begin with? That’s the problem Valar is trying to solve. CEO Anirudh Joshi said that the team met one another at Stanford, where they were looking into AI support for clinical decision-making. In other words, helping both patients and doctors decide which treatment path to take, whether it’s out of two or a dozen. “What we learned is that the majority of cancer patients today, their treatment plan is really unclear,” Joshi said. “They have options, but it’s hard to say what will do well — you just have to try stuff. So our whole idea was to make this an informed decision. In bladder cancer treatment, only one in two patients responds to standard care. If we knew which patient was which, we wouldn’t have to waste a year of therapy on something that doesn’t work.” Valar Labs co-founders (from left) Damir Vrabac, Anirudh Joshi and Viswesh Krishna.Image Credits: Valar Labs The first test they’ve developed, called Vesta, is focused on this specific situation. And it isn’t some theoretical software solution: The team worked with a dozen medical centers around the world to study over 1,000 patients and learn what exactly makes them respond to certain therapies. There are two components to the process: first, a visual AI (or computer vision model) trained on thousands of histology images from cancer patients. These thin slices of affected tissue are increasingly being scanned and inspected by experts, though the process can be somewhat approximate. “This super-high-resolution image tells you a lot about what’s happening at the cellular level of a tumor,” explained CTO Viswesh Krishna. “We run our models on this image to extract a very large amount of features, similar to a genomic panel; we generate thousands of histological reads [i.e. important image features], and take the most important ones that pathologists may be looking at, but can’t really quantify. They might see that they’re different but can’t measure the differences between them.” Example of a processed histology slide — if you look closely, you can see individual features and cells outlined.Image Credits: Valar Labs Joshi was careful to add they are not trying to replace the pathologist, but augment them. You might think of it as a smart microscope that helps an expert make exact measurements in things like cellular damage, immune response and other structures indicative of how the disease is progressing or being inhibited. “In the end, the doctor is always in the driver’s seat. This is just more data, and they like it. And bringing tests like this is a grounding external perspective, and patients really like that,” Joshi said. The imaging component, the team noted, was trained on tons of data and is generalizable across many domains and cancers; counting lymphocytes in breast cancer tissue is largely the same task as doing it in skin cancer tissue. But what that count, or any of the other quantifiable biomarkers the model can identify, says about the patient’s likelihood to respond to treatment is much more limited to specific conditions. Accordingly, the second component of Valar’s system is what really needs to be dialed in on a particular clinical situation. And to that end, the company has demonstrated that, in the specific case of bladder cancer and the standard treatment regimen, its test is far more accurate a predictor of success than any other metric out there. Risk factors like age, health history, whether one smokes and so on are variably predictive of certain treatment outcomes, but these are “very crude,” Joshi noted. Valar claims that their AI models “outperform all those variables [in predictive power], and are independent of them” — meaning they can be used in addition to the standard risk factor, not just in place of them. They also noted that it has been important to keep the results interpretable: The last thing doctors or patients need is a black box. So if it says a patient will respond well, that is supported by “because their immune system is doing A and their nuclei are doing B, etc.” Image Credits: Valar LabsImage Credits: Valar Labs The company, which was founded in 2021, has spent much of its effort building out the image model and its first clinical model, for the aforementioned BCG therapy in bladder cancer patients. As Valar noted in a recent announcement, the test identifies individuals with triple the normal risk of not responding to BCG, meaning (at the care team’s discretion) it is likely a better move to try something else. If that saves even one month of wasted effort, it could be life-changing for some. As anyone who’s lived through cancer care can tell you, not only is every day of treatment incredibly valuable, but confidence is hard to come by. Valar may not offer certainty (near impossible in oncology), but it could be a powerful arrow in caregivers’ quivers. Coinciding with the impending release of its first product, Valar has closed a $22 million Series A round led by DCVC and Andreessen Horowitz, with Pear VC participating. “The fundraise was perfectly timed,” Joshi said. “We were able to complete this validation, and now this funding will help fuel the commercialization of Vesta, and at the same time we’re starting to expand to other cancer types.” The founders said they hope to steadily expand, using a commercial lab model much like genomic testing has followed in recent years, COO Damir Vrabac said: “It’s very similar to these other tests that came before us, it doesn’t add any friction to the health system.” That will hopefully allow them to put the cost on insurance providers, and ultimately lower the cost of care altogether by avoiding unnecessary and ineffective treatments."
2024-06-26,Sonia’s AI chatbot steps in for therapists,AI,"Can chatbots replace human therapists? Some startups — and patients — claim that they can. But it’s not exactly settled science. One study found that 80% of people who’ve used OpenAI’s ChatGPT for mental health advice consider it a good alternative to regular therapy, while a separate report found that chatbots can be effective in reducing certain symptoms related to depression and anxiety. On the other hand, it’s well-established that the relationship between therapist and client — the human connection, in other words — is among the best predictors of success in mental health treatment. Three entrepreneurs — Dustin Klebe, Lukas Wolf and Chris Aeberli — are in the pro-chatbot therapy camp. Their startup, Sonia, offers an “AI therapist” that users can talk to or text with via an iOS app about a range of topics. “To some extent, building an AI therapist is like developing a drug, in the sense that we are building a new technology as opposed to repackaging an existing one,” Aeberli, Sonia’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. The three met in 2018 while studying computer science at ETH Zürich and moved to the U.S. together to pursue graduate studies at MIT. Shortly after graduating, they reunited to launch a startup that could encapsulate their shared passion for scalable tech. That startup became Sonia. Sonia leverages a number of generative AI models to analyze what users say during “therapy sessions” in the app and respond to them. Applying techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy, the app, which charges users $20 per month or $200 per year, gives “homework” aimed at driving home insights from conversations and visualizations designed to help identify top stressors. Image Credits: Sonia Aeberli claims that Sonia, which hasn’t received FDA approval, can tackle issues ranging from depression, stress, and anxiety to relationship problems and poor sleep. For more serious scenarios, like people contemplating violence or suicide, Sonia has “additional algorithms and models” to detect “emergency situations” and direct users to national hotlines, Aeberli says. Somewhat alarmingly, none of Sonia’s founders have backgrounds in psychology. But Aeberli says that the startup consults with psychologists, recently hired a cognitive psychology graduate, and is actively recruiting a full-time clinical psychologist. “It is important to emphasize that we don’t consider human therapists, or any companies providing physical or virtual mental health care conducted by humans, as our competition,” Klebe said. “For every response that Sonia generates, there are about seven additional language model calls happening in the background to analyze the situation from several different therapeutic perspectives in order to adjust, optimize and personalize the therapeutical approach chosen by Sonia.” What about privacy? Can users rest assured that their data isn’t being retained in a vulnerable cloud or used to train Sonia’s models without their knowledge? Aeberli says Sonia is committed to storing only the “absolute minimum” amount of personal information to administer therapy: a user’s age and name. He didn’t address where, how, or for how long Sonia stores conversation data, however. Image Credits: Sonia Sonia, which has around 8,000 users and $3.35 million in backing from investors, including Y Combinator, Moonfire, Rebel Fund and SBXi, is in talks with unnamed mental health organizations to provide Sonia as a resource through their online portals. The reviews for Sonia on the App Store are quite positive so far, with several users noting they find it easier to speak with the chatbot about their issues than a human therapist. But is that a good thing? Today’s chatbot tech is limited in the quality of advice it can give — and it might not pick up on subtler signs indicative of a problem, like an anorexic person asking how to lose weight. (Sonia wouldn’t even know the person’s weight.) Chatbots’ responses are also colored with biases — often the Western biases reflected in their training data. As a result, they’re more likely to miss cultural and linguistic differences in the way a person expresses mental illnesses, particularly if English is that person’s second language. (Sonia only supports English.) In the worst-case scenario, chatbots go off the rails. Last year, the National Eating Disorders Association came under fire for replacing humans with a chatbot, Tessa, that dispensed weight-loss tips that were triggering to people with eating disorders. Klebe emphasized that Sonia isn’t trying to replace human therapists. Image Credits: Sonia “We are building a solution for the millions of people who are struggling with their mental health but can’t (or don’t want to) access a human therapist,” Wolf said. “We aim to fill the gigantic gap between demand and supply.” There’s certainly a gap — both in terms of the ratio of professionals to patients and the cost of treatments versus what most patients can afford. More than half of the U.S. doesn’t have adequate geographic access to mental care, according to a recent government report. And a recent survey found that 42% of U.S. adults with a mental health condition weren’t able to receive care because they couldn’t afford it. A piece in Scientific American talks about therapy apps that cater to the “worried well,” or people who can afford therapy and app subscriptions, and not isolated individuals who might be most at risk but don’t know how to seek help. At $20 per month, Sonia isn’t exactly cheap — but Aeberli argues it’s cheaper than a typical therapy appointment. “It’s a lot easier to start using Sonia than seeing a human therapist, which entails finding a therapist, being on the waitlist for four months, going there at a set time and paying $200,” he said. “Sonia has already seen more patients than a human therapist would see over the course of their entire career.” I only hope that Sonia’s founders remain transparent about the issues that the app can and cannot address as they build it out."
2023-06-07,"Julie Wainwright is back with a new, venture-backed startup",Biotech & Health,"Julie Wainwright, founder and former CEO of the publicly traded, luxury online consignment company The RealReal, is back with a new startup. Called Ahara, the Los Angeles-based outfit describes itself as a personalized nutrition company that provides recommendations to its customers after they first fill out a health questionnaire that asks them about their diet and health history, and their age and location, after which they can take a variety of at-home tests for genetic, epigenetic and biomarkers. According to Ahara, for example, its tests can tell the company how effectively someone is metabolizing specific nutrients; how healthy his or her cells are; and which tests an individual’s blood levels for key nutrients like vitamin D and Omega 3s. Wainwright isn’t a wellness expert, but after leaving The RealReal last June after running the company for 11 years, she teamed up with celebrity physician-nutritionist Melina Jampolis as co-founder. Jampolis is also the outfit’s chief medical doctor. Indeed, in a quiet press release published yesterday, the duo — who already feature half a dozen other employees on their site — including a performance marketer — say they have themselves contributed to a $10.25 million round that was led by Greycroft, with participation from Headline, SHAKTI and entrepreneur Sandy Sholl. Ahara is currently in beta and, according to its own literature, will operate a freemium model that provides special benefits to “premium” members. That the operation appears to require far fewer resources than The RealReal isn’t surprising. Wainwright — who earlier led the dot.com-era company Pets.com — is coming off of a business that’s beloved by its customers but highly challenging from a margins perspective. In conversation last week with investor Ian Sigalow of Greycroft — the firm was also an early backer in The RealReal — he offered his theories about why The RealReal boasts a market cap of just $170 million after reaching a market cap of $2.39 billion the day of its IPO three years ago. Though The RealReal was a “really good idea,” creating a far more vibrant second-hand luxury goods market, the “challenge with the model is that it is very capital intensive. The storage of the garments is expensive. The way that they procure in such a white-glove manner is expensive.” Wainwright “executed really well on the vision, but driving a profitable machine and taking the cost out of it is just very hard to deal with in that business because it’s all basically one-off unique pieces of fashion product, and they all have to be graded. It’s a complicated business to scale.” Ahara joins a growing spate of digital nutrition startups. Though each has a slightly different flavor, over the last six months, Mighty Health, a four-year-old, San Francisco-based startup offering a daily health program designed for adults ages 50 and up, raised $7.6 million in venture backing; Nourish, a San Francisco-based telehealth platform for nutrition, raised $8 million in seed funding; and Zoe, a British nutrition and health tracking app, also attracted the attention of VCs, raising £25 million from investors, to name just a few."
2023-07-12,Fold Health streamlines admin work for primary care providers,Startups,"Abhijit Gupta and Ram Sahasranam have plenty of experience in the health tech space, having sold their first startup, health app maker Praxify, to Athenahealth. Now the duo are focused on value-based care. Fold Health is their operating system for cutting down on the amount of admin work performed by value-based providers. Today, the startup announced it has raised $6 million from Iron Pillar and global angel investors. This brings Fold’s total funding to $12 million. Ten thousand patients currently use Fold, which has offices in San Francisco and Pune. While working on Praxify and other health startups, Gupta and Sahasranam saw several things inhibiting the transition to value-based care, which ties provider reimbursement to patient outcome. Existing tech infrastructure did not support outcome-driven models, and it was becoming unsustainable for practices to continue adding point solutions to their tech systems. Staffing shortages and burnout among primary care physicians was also a concern. Sahasranam says 79% of primary care physicians experience burnout, because they typically have 2,500 to 3,000 patient panels in their care, which means that they are only able to see their patients when sick. One problem Fold is solving for practices transitioning to value-based care is data tools, since value-based care relies on accurately tracking and leveraging patient data for care decisions. Its platform can replace or integrate with existing systems. Without Fold, its founders say that many primary care providers have spent money on point solutions that don’t really click with one another or turned to building their own tech suites. An OS for primary care, Fold integrates with electronic health records and gives users modular tools to customize the OS. Features include a workflow engine that automates much of the work required by value-based providers, including care gap closure, transitional care management, annual wellness visit completions, high-risk patient engagement and attribution growth and protection. The care team enablement suite gathers all patient data, task management, omni-channel communications and scheduling to coordinate care teams. The Patient-Enablement suite is a white-labeled patient web and app portal that allows them to keep in touch with their care teams. One use case of how Fold has been used by providers includes one early adopter, a primary care clinic that had high burnout rates among staff because of their fragmented tech ecosystem. Sahasranam says that by switching to Fold’s unified platform, it reduced the amount of time spent on administrative tasks, allowing providers more time for patient care. Fold Health will use its new funding to add to new features focusing on primary care consumers and reducing administrative inefficiencies."
2023-10-31,DeepMind’s latest AlphaFold model is more useful for drug discovery,AI,"Nearly five years ago, DeepMind, one of Google’s more prolific AI-centered research labs, debuted AlphaFold, an AI system that can accurately predict the structures of many proteins inside the human body. Since then, DeepMind has improved on the system, releasing an updated and more capable version of AlphaFold — AlphaFold 2 — in 2020. And the lab’s work continues. Today, DeepMind revealed that the newest release of AlphaFold, the successor to AlphaFold 2, can generate predictions for nearly all molecules in the Protein Data Bank, the world’s largest open access database of biological molecules. Already, Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind focused on drug discovery, is applying the new AlphaFold model — which it co-designed — to therapeutic drug design, according to a post on the DeepMind blog, helping to characterize different types of molecular structures important for treating disease. New capabilities The new AlphaFold’s capabilities extend beyond protein prediction. DeepMind claims that the model can also accurately predict the structures of ligands — molecules that bind to “receptor” proteins and cause changes in how cells communicate — as well as nucleic acids (molecules that contain key genetic information) and post-translational modifications (chemical changes that occur after a protein’s created). Image Credits: DeepMind Predicting protein-ligand structures can be a useful tool in drug discovery, DeepMind notes, as it can help scientists identify and design new molecules that could become drugs. Currently, pharmaceutical researchers use computer simulations known as “docking methods” to determine how proteins and ligands will interact. Docking methods require specifying a reference protein structure and a suggested position on that structure for the ligand to bind to. With the latest AlphaFold, however, there’s no need to use a reference protein structure or suggested position. The model can predict proteins that haven’t been “structurally characterized” before, while at the same time simulating how proteins and nucleic acids interact with other molecules — a level of modeling that DeepMind says isn’t possible with today’s docking methods. “Early analysis also shows that our model greatly outperforms [the previous generation of] AlphaFold on some protein structure prediction problems that are relevant for drug discovery, like antibody binding,” DeepMind writes in the post. “Our model’s dramatic leap in performance shows the potential of AI to greatly enhance scientific understanding of the molecular machines that make up the human body.” The newest AlphaFold isn’t perfect, though. In a whitepaper detailing the system’s strengths and limitations, researchers at DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs reveal that the system falls short of the best-in-class method for predicting the structures of RNA molecules — the molecules in the body that carry the instructions for making proteins. Doubtless, both DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs are working to address this."
2023-05-07,"Elizabeth Holmes, left to her own devices",Biotech & Health,"Critics are flaming The New York Times for posting earlier this morning what they say is an overly empathetic 5,500-word profile of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. But writer Amy Chozick is in on the con. In fact, her story may provide the clearest understanding yet of how Holmes so captivated investors, business partners and the U.S. media, before The Wall Street Journal finally blew the lid on her company beginning in late 2015. Nice to be a pretty white lady working your charm on a nyt reporter. — Soledad O’Brien (@soledadobrien) May 7, 2023 pretty incredible to write a performatively angsty bazillion-word profile of Elizabeth Holmes without ever addressing the certainty that her lies would have killed people if she hadn’t been busted, or the equal certainty that she herself knew this — Albert Burneko (@AlbertBurneko) May 7, 2023 It’s not an easy thing to pull off. First, as any reporter can tell you, writing a profile piece that does not feature at least some puffery is not easy, and profiling someone like Holmes has to be more complicated than most. She hasn’t talked to the media since 2016, and she is a highly persuasive character who managed to make many powerful people bend to her will. As former Theranos employee and whistleblower Tyler Shultz told CBS News early last year of Holmes, “Elizabeth is a very, very charismatic person. When she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.” While Chozick might have written a heavier-handed story — one that people who reflexively read the story might have preferred — the brilliance of this piece is that she takes the opposite approach. She lets Holmes perform her magic but offers a peek behind the curtain as Holmes does it. Holmes pulls a lot out of her hat. Chozick spends time with not only Holmes, her romantic partner, Billy Evans, and their two children, but also Holmes’s parents and others in Holmes’s orbit. Holmes and Evans take Chozick to the beach with their dog, Teddy. They invite her to join them for Mexican food at their quaint rental home on the Pacific coast. They visit the San Diego Zoo together and, in a separate meeting, have croissants and berries and coffee made by Evans. Chozick doesn’t need to mention each of these outings discretely, but by doing so, she let us witness Holmes’s subtle charm campaign as if we were there with her. Holmes — whose prison sentence was recently delayed — grows so confident in Chozick’s presence that she even imagines inventing another Theranos. “I still dream about being able to contribute in that space,” Holmes tells her. “I still feel the same calling to it as I always did and I still think the need is there.” The campaign almost works. “I realized that I was essentially writing a story about two different people,” Chozick writes. ”There was Elizabeth, celebrated in the media as a rock-star inventor whose brilliance dazzled illustrious rich men, and whose criminal trial captivated the world. Then there is ‘Liz,’ (as Mr. Evans and her friends call her), the mom of two who, for the past year, has been volunteering for a rape crisis hotline. Who can’t stomach R-rated movies and who rushed after me one afternoon with a paper towel to wipe a mix of sand and her dog’s slobber off my shoe.” The writer is so dazzled by “Liz” and finds her so “normal” that her editors have to snap her out of her trance, after which she begins to see the picture more clearly. Writes Chozick, “I was admittedly swept up in Liz as an authentic and sympathetic person. She’s gentle and charismatic, in a quiet way. My editor laughed at me when I shared these impressions, telling me (and I quote), ‘Amy Chozick, you got rolled!’” Initially, she doubts her editor, saying she is certain she has come to know Holmes in a way that might surprise readers. But then, she adds, “something very strange happened. I worked my way through a list of Ms. Holmes’s friends, family and longtime supporters, whom she and Mr. Evans suggested I speak to. One of these friends said Ms. Holmes had genuine intentions at Theranos and didn’t deserve a lengthy prison sentence. Then, this person requested anonymity to caution me not to believe everything Ms. Holmes says.” At another point, Chozick is again understated about seeing behind the artifice, writing, “Ms. Holmes’s story of how she got here — to the bright, cozy house and the supportive partner and the two babies — feels a lot like the story of someone who had finally broken out of a cult and been deprogrammed. After her relationship with Mr. Balwani ended and Theranos dissolved, Ms. Holmes said, ‘I began my life again.’ But then I remember that Ms. Holmes was running the cult.” As the story ends, Chozick deliberately marvels at how much more time Holmes and Evans want to spend with her, inviting her to join them and their friends for yet another dinner, asking if she would like to come back for another date to the zoo with her own family. “I appreciated their hospitality,” she writes, “but I didn’t fully understand it. Usually interview subjects can’t wait to get rid of me.” Then Chozick realizes why they “keep opening the door wider.” If “you are in her presence, it is impossible not to believe her, not to be taken with her and be taken in by her.” The observation brings to mind something else Shultz said about his time at Theranos in that interview with CBS News last year. “Even when I was working with the product every single day, seeing it fail time after time after time,” he’d said, “I could go and have a five-minute conversation with Elizabeth and feel like I was saving the world again.”"
2022-12-15,"MyHealth Africa, a startup connecting patients with health specialists across the globe, lands $1M funding",Startups,"Kenya-based MyHealth Africa, an integrated healthcare platform changing how people access medical services by connecting patients with local and international health specialists and hospitals, is growing its reach in Africa, and plans to further expand in the Middle East and South Asia next year. The growth plan comes against the backdrop of $1 million seed funding it has raised in a round led by GIIG Africa Fund, with participation from Japanese-based Samurai VC, a family office and existing investors. This brings the total amount raised by the startup, which received its pre-seed funding last year, to $1.3 million. The new funding also follows a Top HealthTech Startup in Africa award the startup clinched in June this year from the Global Startup Awards (GSA) Africa, an exclusive vehicle for the GIIG Africa Fund to find, fund and scale the continent’s innovative startups. mPharma raises $35 million in round joined by Tinder co-founder’s JAM fund, Bharti executive “MyHealth Africa plans to invest the funds to continue rapidly expanding across Africa. We also plan to launch two new regions in 2023, including the Middle East and South Asia, which are already our second and third-largest markets. We assist hundreds of patients each month from these two markets to access specialized healthcare services at our network of leading hospitals in the Middle East, Europe, South Asia and Asia, currently from our office in Kenya,” said MyHealth Africa founder and CEO Ryan Marincowitz. Marincowitz founded MyHealth Africa in 2017 as a specialized healthcare booking platform and medical management system, to make it possible for patients to access healthcare services virtually or in-person from doctors and providers across the globe. MyHealth Africa is among the list of startups in Africa solving inefficiencies in the health sector by making healthcare easily accessible across a continent where medical tourism to other regions is rife, disease burden is highest and patient-to-doctor ratio is lowest in the world. According to World Health Organization, countries across sub-Saharan Africa have 0.23 doctors for every 10,000 people, against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in the most developed countries. MyHealth Africa says it assists more than 1,200 patients monthly, having grown month on month patient visits by an average of 11% in 2022. The startup has so far assisted over 27,000 patients to access specialized healthcare services from more than 1,500 medical professionals and health facilities. “Across the continent, we have seen over the past few years how technology and innovation are having a real impact on the health and wellness of Africans,” said GIIG Africa co-founder Philip Baldwin. “When we first encountered MyHealth Africa during the last season of GSA Africa, we became engrossed in learning how this startup was revolutionizing the East African healthcare landscape. And today, we could not be more pleased to announce our formal partnership in helping take the MyHealth Africa solution to the world,” he said.

2022-12-14,Bollywood star Deepika Padukone’s skincare startup attracts VC backing,Startups,"Deepika Padukone’s skincare startup 82°E, pronounced Eighty Two East, said Wednesday it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding, as the Bollywood star makes a further push into the startup world. DSG Consumer Partners and IDEO Ventures are among those who backed 82°E, said the startup, which began offering self-care products such as moisturisers and sunscreen drops to consumers in more than 30 countries last month. 82°E says its products are formulated in-house by R&D experts and feature “time-tested Indian ingredients.” “Jigar [Shah, the other co-founder] and I envisioned this brand as an extension of my personal as well as professional journey,” said Padukone in a statement. “We set out to launch products which are high-quality, high-performing and an authentic reflection of my beliefs and practices. In this endeavour, we aim to make the practice of self-care simple, joyful and effective for all. With our launch category of skincare products, we have rigorously sourced, carefully crafted and clinically tested our products to achieve lasting results. I am honoured to have investors of global repute join us in our vision to establish 82°E as a modern self-care brand born in India for the world.” The tech-savvy star, who is among the highest paid actresses in India, has emerged as a prolific investor in recent years. In 2017, she launched KA Enterprises, a fully owned holding company, through which she has backed several startups, including unicorn online beauty store Purplle, satellite/aerospace manufacturing firm Bellatrix, yoghurt firm Epigamia and pet store Supertails. Bollywood stars and cricketers including Shahid Kapoor, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Anushka Sharma, Hardik Pandya and Priyanka Chopra have made over a dozen investments in recent years, sometimes in a sweat equity arrangement where they endorse the brand and collect part of the fee as shares."
2023-09-14,"Microsoft open sources EvoDiff, a novel protein-generating AI",Startups,"Proteins, the natural molecules that carry out key cellular functions within the body, are the building blocks of all diseases. Characterizing proteins can reveal the mechanisms of a disease, including ways to slow it or potentially reverse it, while creating proteins can lead to entirely new classes of drugs and therapeutics. But the current process for designing proteins in the lab is costly — both from a computational and human resource standpoint. It entails coming up with a protein structure that could plausibly perform a specific task inside the body, then finding a protein sequence — the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein — likely to “fold” into that structure. (Proteins must correctly fold into three-dimensional shapes to carry out their intended function.) It doesn’t necessarily have to be this complicated. This week, Microsoft introduced a general-purpose framework, EvoDiff, that the company claims can generate “high-fidelity,” “diverse” proteins given a protein sequence. Different from other protein-generating frameworks, EvoDiff doesn’t require any structural information about the target protein, cutting out what’s typically the most laborious step. Available in open source, EvoDiff could be used to create enzymes for new therapeutics and drug delivery methods as well as new enzymes for industrial chemical reactions, Microsoft senior researcher Kevin Yang says. “We envision that EvoDiff will expand capabilities in protein engineering beyond the structure-function paradigm towards programmable, sequence-first design,” Yang, one of the co-creators of EvoDiff, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “With EvoDiff, we’re demonstrating that we may not actually need structure, but rather that ‘protein sequence is all you need’ to controllably design new proteins.” Core to the EvoDiff framework is a 640-million parameter model trained on data from all different species and functional classes of proteins. (“Parameters” are the parts of an AI model learned from training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem — in this case generating proteins.) The data to train the model was sourced from the OpenFold data set for sequence alignments and UniRef50, a subset of data from UniProt, the database of protein sequence and functional information maintained by the UniProt consortium. EvoDiff is a diffusion model, similar in architecture to many modern image-generating models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2. EvoDiff learns how to gradually subtract noise from a starting protein made almost entirely of noise, moving it closer — slowly, step by step — to a protein sequence. The process by which EvoDiff generates proteins. Image Credits: Microsoft EvoDiff Diffusion models have been increasingly applied to domains outside of image generation, from conjuring up designs for novel proteins, like EvoDiff, to creating music and even synthesizing speech. “If there’s one thing to take away [from EvoDiff], I think it’d be this idea that we can — and should — do protein generation over sequence because of the generality, scale and modularity that we’re able to achieve,” Microsoft senior researcher Ava Amini, another co-contributor on EvoDiff, said via email. “Our diffusion framework gives us the ability to do that and also to control how we design these proteins to meet specific functional goals.” To Amini’s point, EvoDiff can not only create new proteins but fill in the “gaps” in an existing protein design, so to speak. Provided a part of a protein that binds to another protein, the model can generate a protein amino acid sequence around that part that meets a set of criteria, for example. Because EvoDiff designs proteins in the “sequence space” rather than the structure of proteins, it can also synthesize “disordered proteins” that don’t end up folding into a final three-dimensional structure. Like normal functioning proteins, disordered proteins play important roles in biology and disease, like enhancing or decreasing other protein activity. Now, it should be noted that the research behind EvoDiff hasn’t been peer reviewed — at least not yet. Sarah Alamdari, a data scientist at Microsoft who contributed to the project, admits that there’s “a lot more scaling work” to be done before the framework can be used commercially. “This is just a 640-million-parameter model, and we may see improved generation quality if we scale up to billions of parameters,” Alamdari said via email. “While we demonstrated some coarse-grained strategies, to achieve even more fine-grained control, we would want to condition EvoDiff on text, chemical information or other ways to specify the desired function.” As a next step, the EvoDiff team plans to test the proteins that the model generated in the lab to determine whether they’re viable. If they turn out to be, they’ll begin work on the next generation of the framework."
2024-01-09,Alphabet quantum spin-out Sandbox AQ acquires Good Chemistry,Startups,"Sandbox AQ, the AI and quantum firm spun out of Google parent company Alphabet in 2022, has acquired Good Chemistry, a Vancouver-based quantum and computational chemistry startup, for an undisclosed sum. Good Chemistry, founded by Arman Zaribafiyan in 2021 as a spin-off of quantum computing company 1QBit and backed by investors including Green Sands Equity and Accenture Ventures, offers cloud-based tools to accelerate material design. Good Chemistry’s platform lets chemistry developers build chemical simulation apps and workflows using algorithms in quantum chemistry and machine learning as well as quantum computing. In a press release, Sandbox AQ VP Nadia Carlsten said that the acquisition will expand Sandbox’s global presence in addition to adding “proven technologies,” including simulation technologies, and major customers (such as Dow Chemical) to its portfolio. New investors are a part of the deal, too — all of Good Chemistry’s backers have joined Sandbox AQ’s investor base, Carlsten added. “Good Chemistry’s software and existing partnerships will enable us to rapidly accelerate how we bring the benefits of advanced simulation and AI tools to more customers,” Carlsten said. “Combining our capabilities will give Sandbox AQ an advanced and scalable computing platform for highly accurate chemical simulation on a scale that makes impactful use cases such as new drug and material synthesis possible.” Sandbox AQ sees simulation as increasingly central to its work, which spans drug discovery and material design across the agricultural, defense, energy, medical and manufacturing sectors. With Good Chemistry, the company gains 25 computational and quantum chemists, AI and software engineers and quantum computing scientists skilled in leveraging simulation tech; tellingly, Zaribafiyan is joining Sandbox as head of product for simulation platforms while Good Chemistry’s staff is assuming roles in Sandbox’s existing simulation teams. “The rapid advances in AI, quantum, cloud and high-performance computing have unlocked endless opportunities for companies like Good Chemistry and Sandbox AQ to reinvent the way we think about chemistry, discover ways to make products safer, stronger and more sustainable, and reshape the fabric of our world,” Zaribafiyan said in a canned statement. “[Tapping] the broader Sandbox AQ reach and domain expertise will supercharge the capabilities of our platform.” As part of the acquisition, Sandbox AQ says that it’ll integrate Good Chemistry’s software, Qemist Cloud and Tangelo, into its enterprise software portfolio. Qemist lets users take advantage of quantum chemistry through simulation, while Tangelo allows them to conduct chemistry experiments across quantum cloud providers and hardware devices. Good Chemistry is Sandbox’s second acquisition. In 2022, it bought Cryptosense, an enterprise-focused software-as-a-service cybersecurity and encryption startup."
2023-06-08,Cultured meat startup Higher Steaks nabs $30M and rebrands as Uncommon,Biotech & Health,"U.K.-based cultivated meat startup Higher Steaks has raised $30 million in a Series A round of funding and revealed that it’s changing its name to Uncommon. Founded out of Cambridge in 2017, Uncommon is one of countless companies pushing to make cultured “lab-grown” meat a reality in kitchens and restaurants around the globe, covering everything from synthetic sausages and bogus burgers to pseudo-seafood. Uncommon, for its part, is mostly focused on the $250 billion global pork market, developing bacon and pork belly products. Hurdles Uncommon founders: Chief science officer Dr. Ruth Faram with CEO Benjamina Bollag Image Credits: Uncommon Regulatory hurdles has meant that meat made from animal cells in a test tube have been slow to gain a foothold, with Singapore currently the only market in the world where cultured meat is available for sale. The Food and Drug Association (FDA) in the U.S. also recently started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption. Some countries, though, are pushing back against the burgeoning fake-meat revolution, including Italy which is mulling an outright ban on lab-developed food to safeguard its culinary heritage. But another longstanding challenge of bringing cultivated meat to market has been scalability. Being able to produce large enough quantities of cultured meat at a low enough price is problematic, with some companies pursuing a hybrid lab-grown meat / plant-based protein approach to get their products to market faster. Uncommon, though, says it’s using a technique involving a polymeric molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid), or more specifically mRNA, which essentially contains “instructions” that enable cells to make proteins from its own internal functions. “This also means that Uncommon can create real meat without using genetic engineering,” Uncommon co-founder and CEO Benjamina Bollag told TechCrunch. “With countries becoming increasingly against genetically engineered food, Uncommon hopes that this means it can scale its cultivated meat across the world with regulatory challenges.” Moreover, Bollag says that it’s using this patent-pending technique to help bring cultivated meat closer to price parity with traditional meat. “With this method, it’s also possible to more directly target muscle and fat regulators in the cells when compared to growth factors and small molecules, in a similar fashion as gene editing,” Bollag said. “This in turn reduces the quantity of raw materials needed, which makes it possible to scale the process at a reduced cost compared to using genetic engineering.” Uncommon’s $30 million Series A round was led by London-based Balderton Capital and New York’s Lowercarbon Capital, with participation from a number institutional and angel investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and his brother Max, as well as Redalpine, East Alpha, Miray Zaki and Sebastiano Castiglioni. The company said that it plans to use its fresh cash injection to scale up production and kickstart its regulatory approval process in Europe and Singapore, while keeping a “close eye” on the U.S. market. “Singapore is likely to receive the approval first as it is the most developed ecosystem for cultivated meat, with other markets to follow,” Bollag said, though with little indication as to when commercialization might being. “We will be starting with high-end restaurants first before moving to supermarkets.”"
2023-10-16,Leucine makes drug manufacturing compliance less onerous,Biotech & Health,"The compliance process at pharmaceutical manufacturers is complicated because many still use paper-based systems to record manufacturing steps. These paper records are reviewed by FDA auditors to ensure that guidelines were followed, but they are prone to errors, often leading to warnings. This results in higher costs and slower manufacturing. Leucine wants to make the compliance process more efficient with its compliance cloud platform for the pharmaceutical industry. It automatically creates digital manufacturing records and uses AI to identify the root cause of deviations. New York-based Leucine announced today it has raised a $7 million Series A led by strategic investor Ecolab Inc. Participants include returning investors like Pravega Ventures, Axilor Ventures, Techstars and angel investors. Founded in 2019, Leucine is currently used by over 30 companies in more than 300 pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in 10 countries, including the U.S., India, Brazil, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. Its target customers include new biotech firms and pharmaceutical giants. Leucine describes itself as “a digital twin of the pharma manufacturing shop floor.” It enables real-time performance monitoring and compliance management, analyzes the root cause of deviations from proper operating procedures, gives users advice on how to improve efficiency and creates manufacturing records and audit reports. It can be onboarded in eight weeks because of a proprietary AI-enabled system that digitizes paper SOPs to create custom workflows. Co-founder and CEO Vivek Gera says Leucine can reduce the digitization cycle of a batch cycle from six to eight weeks to just three to five days. In addition to its funding, Leucine also announced today the beta launch of Leucine 10X, an AI framework that performs specialized tasks like digitizing paper-based SOPs and creating dynamic production plans with production managers to ensure on-time batch delivery. It also makes the root cause analysis of deviations in the manufacturing process faster by analyzing data from text-based records, logs and staff interview transcripts. Leucine’s user interface. Image Credits: Leucine Before starting Leucine, Gera worked as a compliance and automation consultant at Fortune 500 companies. He tells TechCrunch that during his work, he realized the scale of non-compliance issues and the impact they were having on bottom lines. For most of his projects, he introduced companies to technology that helped improve compliance. “However, I noticed that most of the legacy players in this space didn’t offer solutions that brought in compliance by design and moreover didn’t offer any insights to the manufacturers despite hosting vast amounts of data,” he says. This led to the creation of Leucine. By working with co-founder Mustaq Singh Bijral, whose background is in product management and data science, Gera says Leucine was able to build a data-driven product from day one, with the goal of creating a digital platform that is simple to use and has built-in compliance guidelines and process interlocks that ensure compliance. Gera says there are legacy compliance systems that also offer pharmaceutical manufacturing floor digitization, including traditional manufacturing executing systems (MES) like Siemens and Rockwell and newer solutions like MasterControl, Trackwise and Kneat. But he adds that many have very long implementation of cycles, compared to eight weeks for Leucine, which are more difficult to customize and are siloed. They also do not give insights that help prevent potential compliance issues. Leucine also differentiates from its competitors by using its LLM-based proprietary electronic batch manufacturing record (eBMR) to turn paper SOPs into digital workflows within minutes instead of months. Gera said eBMRs are the most important document in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process because it records every step and is reviewed by FDA auditors to see if manufacturers followed GxP, or quality guidelines. “Our models have been trained on large volumes of pharma data and enable us to deliver value to our clients quicker than anyone else,” Gera added. “Our platform caters to all use cases on the shop floor, from batch planning to batch release and breaks the data silos, providing a single source of truth.” Over the last 12 months, Gera says the number of facilities using Leucine has grown by 100%, with a 300% increase in users. This is because facilities are expanding use cases for the platform. It monetizes through a SaaS model with tiered pricing that increases based on volume. Leucine will expand its platforms with more solutions to improve compliance and productivity across the entire pharmaceutical manufacturing ecosystem. It also plans to improve its AI Co-pilot feature. What’s the best way to run a startup in a world full of advice?"
2023-01-04,"Pee is the magic number, as Withings puts a urine analysis lab in your toilet",Biotech & Health,"Withings, best known for its smart scales, watches and other health-focused consumer tech, released a new gadget at CES in Las Vegas today. Making a splash in an underserved market, U-Scan aims to help customers track what’s going on in their urine, without having to worry about catching their wastewater in a cup or messing about with test strips. The device syncs to the company’s ever-expanding Health Mate app and promises to give actionable insights. The U-Scan is designed to be installed in the toilet bowl, which gives users hands-free access to urine analysis. While routine in medical settings, urine is a rarely tapped opportunity for at-home health monitoring. That may change quite a bit over the next few years if Withings has its way. The company points out that urine has more than 3,000 metabolites, giving an immediate snapshot of the body’s balance and health. Tim Draper leads $6M Series A in pee-testing wellness tracker, Vivoo “The ability of U-Scan to perform daily urine analysis from home will allow Withings to take its mission to help consumers fully utilize urine data to an entirely new level,” said Mathieu Letombe, Withings CEO at a press conference. “It’s one of the most exciting and complex products we have ever announced. We begin this journey with U-Scan Cycle Sync and Nutri Balance and look forward to announcing more cartridges on an ongoing basis as well as medical applications of the technology.” The rechargeable U-Scan reader knows the difference between flush water and urine and ensures it collects only the samples it needs. When in use, urine flows efficiently to a collection inlet, activating a pump when a thermal sensor detects the presence of urine. The sample is guided through a microfluidic circuit and injected into a test pod. Here, the reaction is read by an optical sensor and reported back to the app. Every subsequent flush of the toilet cleans the system, resetting it for the next sample collection. In Europe, the U-Scan Nutri Balance app shows an analysis of specific gravity, pH, vitamin C and ketone levels. The combination of these measurements helps people monitor their metabolic intake to optimize their daily hydration and nutrients. The “actionable” part of that is that the system can recommend workouts, offer dietary suggestions and recipes — all to help health-conscious users achieve their goals. The company points out that U.S. functionality of Nutri Balance may vary, depending on what the FDA has to say about the matter. Check out this first of its kind, direct-to-consumer urine-testing app with FDA clearance The product will make its debut in Europe with two different health cartridges aimed at consumers. Medically focused cartridges will follow in the not-too-distant future. The price tag is €499.95 and includes one U-Scan reader and a cartridge providing three months of testing. The first two cartridges that are becoming available are Cycle Sync, which will help people who have monthly cycles track them, and a Nutri Balance cartridge, which will give a detailed metabolic guide for nutrition and hydration. The company isn’t sure when the device will be made available in the U.S. as its launch will be depending on FDA clearance. Incredibly, U-Scan can tell the difference between various users (and therefore assigning the results to the correct person using the device), through it’s amazingly named Stream ID feature. Low-energy radar sensors embedded within the reader measure multiple variables to identify an individual’s “urine stream signature” by detecting the movement and distance of the stream. Stream ID information can be affirmed in the app. In addition to the consumer-focused product, Withings Health Solutions, the company’s business-to-business division serving the healthcare provider market, is making the technology available to partners for research purposes. The company told TechCrunch it is planning to make the cartridges available on a subscription basis or on an individual basis."
2023-08-23,"Backed by Peak XV and Jungle, Neurowyzr puts the focus on brain health",Biotech & Health,"The rate of dementia is expected to double every 20 years, but many tools for early detection, like MRI scans, are difficult for patients to access. Neurowyzr wants to help more people get brain healthcare through tools like its online Digital Brain Function Screen (DBFS). The startup, which has offices in Singapore and India, announced today it has raised $2.1 million in seed funding. The oversubscribed round was led by Jungle Ventures and Peak XV’s (formerly Sequoia India and Southeast Asia) Surge program, with participation from angel investors. Neurowyzr has now raised $3.3 million since it was founded in 2019 by Nav Vij and Pang Sze Yunn. It will participate in 2023 Medtech Innovator Asia Pacific, the world’s largest medtech accelerator program. Vij, Neurowyzr’s chief digital neuroscientist, became interested in early brain decline and related therapies while studying for his neuroscience degree at the University of Melbourne. One of his family members was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease at a young age, which motivated Vij to remove obstacles to brain healthcare. Pang, who has worked on pioneering health initiatives, including Asia’s first heart failure monitoring project, got interested in brain healthcare because she saw the impact brain conditions can have on family members, especially women caregivers. Pang told TechCrunch that a lot of work in neurology currently focuses on treatment for serious brain conditions. But brain decline can start 20 to 40 years before a condition like dementia, mental illness or stroke emerges. As a result, early detection is crucial. Neurowyzr co-founders Pang Sze Yunn (CEO) and Nav Vij (chief digital neuroscientist). Image Credits: Neurowyzr Traditional brain tests like pen-and-paper tests can be affected by tester bias, while MRI and CT scans are expensive and inaccessible to many patients. Neurowyzr wants to address the gap with its digital neuroscience assessment tool, the Digital Brain Function Screen (DBFS). Meant to be faster and less costly than traditional cognitive testing, DBFS is currently used by healthcare organizations like Parkway Shenton, SATA Commhealth, Farrer Park Hospital, MHC Medical Centre (Amara) and O’Joy in Singapore. It has also completed a pilot with a large private hospital chain in India and is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Singapore Health Sciences Authority and Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration. Pang said the DBFS can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes. It assesses a patient’s immediate memory, working memory, attention and executive brain function through a series of gamified neuroscience puzzles. For example, one puzzle has dots with a number on each scattered across the screen, and asks the users to connect them in order. Another shows a series of numbers that users need to memorize and then write in order. DBFS is hosted online, so patients can access it through a web browser link at home, though it was designed for primary care settings. Neurowyzr’s new funding will be used on product development and regional expansion in Southeast Asia and India. The startup is currently working with academic organizations like the NTU Lee Kong Chian School Medicine’s Dementia Research Centre to develop more digital brain health solutions, with the goal of decreasing undetected cases of early brain decline. In a statement, Jungle Ventures healthcare partner Seemant Jauhari said, “Projected numbers tell a stark story for Asia: over the next two decades, more than 66 million individuals could face dementia, while mild cognitive impairment could affect over 400 million. Neurowyzr is a direct response to this challenge. By assessing brain and mental health promptly, we’re building a proactive defense against potential epidemic.” It’s never too late to align product-market fit metrics with your company’s values"
2023-06-05,Apple Watch can now tell you where you last had cell coverage,Biotech & Health,"At WWDC today, Apple revealed that watchOS 10 is introducing a slew of new features — including some potentially lifesaving tools for athletes both professional and, well, not. One of the more interesting features is showing you where you last had cell coverage on your hike. In watchOS 10, the Compass app will automatically generate two new waypoints for you. A new cellular connection waypoint indicates the last place you had cell reception with your own carrier. Perfect if you need to check your messages or make a call. If you find yourself knee-deep in “I need some help,” Apple’s got you covered there, too: A second waypoint shows where you can make an emergency call using any carrier’s network. These features come in addition to Apple’s SOS over satellite functionality on iPhone 14, which is already saving lives."
2020-12-03,Everlywell raises $175 million to expand virtual care options and scale its at-home health testing,Biotech & Health,"Digital health startup Everlywell has raised a $175 million Series D funding round, following relatively fast on the heels of a $25 million Series C round it closed in February of this year. The Series D included a host of new investors, including BlackRock, The Chernin Group (TCG), Foresite Capital, Greenspring Associates, Morningside Ventures and Portfolio, along with existing investors including Highland Capital Partners, which led the Series C round. The startup has now raised more than $250 million to date. Everlywell, which launched to the public at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 as a participant in Startup Battlefield, specializes in home healthcare, and specifically on home healthcare tests supported by their digital platform for providing customers with their results and helping them understand the diagnostics, and how to seek the right follow-on care and expert medical advice. Earlier this year, Everlywell launched an at-home COVID-19 test collection kit — the first of this type of test to receive an emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its use that allowed cooperation with multiple lab service providers over time. The COVID-19 test kit joins its many other offerings, which include tests for thyroid hormone levels, food and allergen sensitivity, women’s health and fertility, vitamin D deficiency and more. I spoke to Everlywell CEO and founder Julia Cheek about the raise, and she acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic was definitely behind the decision to raise such a large amount so quickly again after the close of the Series C, since the company saw a sharp increase in demand coming out of the coronavirus crisis — not only for its COVID-19 test kit, but for at-home digital healthcare options in general. Everlywell gains first FDA authorization for a standalone, at-home, COVID-19 test sample collection kit “We obviously have a very successful COVID-19 test,” she said. “But we’ve also seen three-fourths of our test menu just explode at well over 100% year-over-year growth, and several of our tests are at 4x or 5x growth. That is really representative of this shift in consumer health behavior that will continue in a big way in many different verticals that include testing, and making things more convenient, digitally-enabled, and in the home.” Like other companies built on solving for a shift to more remote and virtual care options, Cheek said that Everlywell had already anticipated this kind of consumer demand — but COVID-19 has dramatically accelerated the pace of change, which is why the startup put together this round, at this size, this quickly (she says they started the process of putting together the Series D in September). “We’ve been talking about the digital health movement, and the consumer-directed movement probably for a decade now,” she told me. “I do believe that this will be the watershed moment, unfortunately. But hopefully, we will come out on the other side of the pandemic and say, ‘There are some good things that happened broadly for healthcare.’ That is the hope of what we lean into everyday, and fundamentally, why we went out and raised this amount of capital in this tremendous growth year.” Image Credits: EverlywellImage Credits: Everlywell Everlywell has also expanded availability of its products this year, with distribution in more than 10,000 retail locations across Target, Walgreens, CVS and Kroger stores across the U.S. The company also landed a number of new partnerships on the diagnostic lab and insurance payer side, as well as with major employers — a key customer group as employers shoulder the largest share of healthcare spending in the U.S. due to employee benefit plans. Cheek says that despite their commercial and enterprise customer wins, the focus remains squarely on consumer satisfaction, which is what distinguishes their offering. “Our COVID-19 test is 75% new people buying our product, and it has an NPS [net promoter score] of 75,” she said. “And then it’s the most highly referred product, and also one of our top tests where people buy other tests. Experience matters here — we know that if someone is a promoter of Everlywell, if they rate us a nine or a 10, on NPS, they are five times more likely to purchase again on the platform.” EverlyWell brings lab tests home, personalized health data online That’s not new for Everlywell, according to Cheek — customers have always had a high degree of satisfaction with the company’s products. But what is new is the expanded reach, and the realization among many Americans that virtual care and at-home options are available, and are effective. “What you have is this lightbulb moment for Americans in a new way that care can be delivered where then they definitely don’t want to go back,” she said. “It’s not just for Everlywell. This is all of these verticals, that have really shifted consumer behavior around healthcare in the home, and I think that will be somewhat permanent. That is the main driver here, and is what we’re seeing, and it’s why Everlywell has resonated so well with so many Americans.”"
2022-12-01,Lumen raises $62M for its handheld weight loss hardware,Hardware,"Losing weight sucks. It’s a deeply invidualized experience that’s bogged down by all sorts of societal expectations and fly-by-night promises. Many have amassed fortunes promising silver bullet solutions, all knowing full well that there isn’t any one-size-fits-all solution. The promise at the heart of Lumen’s offering is a personalized health solution, based on individual metabolism. It’s certainly an appealing one — particularly for those who have struggled to meet their individual weight goals through more traditional methods. We’ve been following the Israeli firm’s own journey for several years now, including a crowdfunding round back in 2018. The following year, the company brought in $8.5 million. Today it’s announcing a $62 million Series B. The round, led by Pitango Venture Capital, is easily the startup’s largest to date. Hanwha Group, Resolute Ventures, RiverPark Ventures, Unorthodox Ventures, Almeda Capital and Disruptive VC also participated. Lumen developed a handheld hardware device that looks a bit like a vape. A built-in sensor measures the level of CO2 produced to determine “metabolic fuel usage” — whether the body is burning carbs or fat for fuel. It connects to a smartphone and the associated app gives you personalized food, exercise and sleep recommendations. The company claims it’s able to accomplish in a $250 package (the personalized plans go up from there) what had previously taken expensive lab equipment to do. It’s an appealing promise, for sure. “Until now, studying metabolism with the standard equipment was challenging for both researchers and participants,” co-founder and chief scientist Merav Mor said in a release. “The data collection was minimal and would require participants to come to a clinic for each measurement and a practitioner to analyze the results. Now researchers can easily collect multiple data points from participants and build more complex research protocols that unveil new physiological findings.” The company hasn’t offered specific sales figures, but says that two million monthly metabolic measurements are taken using its devices. The new funding will go toward “support[ing] business growth and new research.”"
2024-03-13,"With cycle tracking, Withings considers taking half of the population seriously",Gadgets,"Whenever I talk to people working in the quantified self — fitness and health trackers — there’s a murmuring about how little attention is given to literally half the population. For people who menstruate, cycle tracking is a crucial health indicator, but all too often it’s a metric that somehow seems to slip between the cracks. Withings started previewing its cycle tracking feature in some markets in September 2023 when the ScanWatch 2 launched. The company just rolled out the feature globally, on-watch for the ScanWatch 2 and ScanWatch Light smart hybrid watches, and for all Withings users in the app. The company is lagging significantly behind its arch-rival Apple, which launched a comparable feature four years earlier. Withings’ ScanWatch 2 arrives with temperature sensing At its core, the cycle tracking feature enables users to log their menstrual cycle stages, including symptoms, flow and period dates, as well as record moods and emotions and have a view of where they are in their cycle. Once the app gets to know your typical cycle, it predicts future period dates, helping users create personal routines that align with their monthly needs and optimize sleep, activity and nutrition. What took you so long? TechCrunch spoke with Etienne Trégaro, product manager in charge of, among other things, the company’s watches. “The menstrual cycle tracking feature was one of the top feature requests of our community. That’s why it’s important for us to provide this feature to the new ScanWatch,” said Trégaro in an interview with TechCrunch. I am not surprised that this was one of the most requested features. What surprised me is why it has taken Withings so long to launch the feature — and why it’s a fully manual feature. The implementation of the feature relies on people entering data manually, rather than, say, using biometric data such as heartrate, temperature or something else to track cycles more automatically. (Incidentally, it is possible to use temperature tracking as a proxy for cycle tracking, but you have to be very accurate with the measurement). As I write this, women’s health is front and center of the Withings website. Image Credits: Facsimile of the Withings home page. “We have been very focused on health in general, with new biomarkers and innovative ways to track health. Choosing which feature will be developed next is hard. So [cycle tracking] came a little bit — maybe you’d say late — but we do want to be able to monitor activity, heart and other metrics first. We measure things that competitors are not doing, such as temperature 24/7. Nobody’s doing that on the market yet. Except us,” says Trégaro. “So now we felt that our team was ready to release this feature. I’ve learned a lot, also, doing the development of this feature. As a man, of course, to be honest, and by working with female colleagues and professionals to understand the importance of launching such a tool was really key.” I was mildly surprised that the company couldn’t find a product manager who has had the experience of tracking their cycles in the past, but I was curious what Trégaro learned along the way. “One of the biggest realizations was that around 25% of women in the world are actually having irregular cycles. So that’s a lot. In addition, something I learned is that from a doctor’s point of view, [cycle tracking is] one of the most important metrics to follow regarding overall health — as important as blood pressure for women, for example,” Trégaro explains. Building the functionality Withings has been at the forefront of health technology for a while; building high-quality, attractive equipment you’d like to have in your home or on your wrist, ranging from smart scales to advanced wristwatches. Each product release has been met with anticipation and excitement, as they consistently deliver on form and function. Persistent rumors of Apple wanting to buy Withings refuse to die down, but nobody on either side is willing to confirm nor deny them. Trégaro explains that menstrual cycle tracking represents a significant leap forward in personalized health monitoring. For too long, the tech world’s approach to health has been somewhat generic, focusing on step counting, heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking. Important as these metrics are, they offer an incomplete picture of an individual’s health. By integrating menstrual cycle tracking, Withings acknowledges the complex and nuanced nature of health — and adds more features to help track, measure and predict. Maybe it’s late (ironic, really, in the world of cycle tracking), but the introduction shows Withings’ ongoing commitment to listening to its community and understanding the diverse needs of its users. To its credit, in a market that’s crowded with gadgets vying for attention, Withings has managed to carve out a niche for itself by focusing on meaningful innovation. The market Withings is going after with its cycle tracking feature is absolutely mind-bogglingly large. The app stores are heaving with tracking apps, and some analysts predict that the money spent on cycle tracking alone is at $750 million already, and will double by 2032. Addressing this need required Withings to embark on an extensive development process, which involved both the adaption of existing hardware and the creation of new algorithms. Trégaro and his team spent months researching and developing, working closely with health professionals to ensure accuracy and reliability. Trégaro explains that Withings goal was not just to add another feature — the team wanted to integrate menstrual cycle tracking seamlessly into our users’ health monitoring routines, providing them with valuable insights that could inform their daily lives. In the U.S. in particular, period tracking is in the spotlight for not-great-reasons related to abortion-related legislation. Consumers swap period tracking apps in search of increased privacy following Roe v. Wade ruling It is reassuring, then, that Withings highlighted its commitment to privacy and security. With sensitive health data at stake, Withings says it implemented robust measures to protect users’ information — although the company has also opened the door to syncing your data with platforms like Apple Health. It’s worth highlighting the differences between Withings and Apple’s approaches. Whereas the Apple Watch is the do-everything-mini-iPhone-on-your wrist, Withing’s watches are taking a different tack. “We have our strengths [over Apple Watch]. We have a market-leading battery life of up to 30 days on our watches, compared to one or two days on the Apple Watch,” Trégaro grins. “And we have a beautiful design — almost like a real wrist watch. That allows us to have this battery life because we have a smaller screen. We focus on continuous health measurement.”"
2024-01-29,Startup studio Hexa hires former Doctolib exec to launch its health vertical,Biotech & Health,"Hexa, the Paris-based startup studio that recently raised $22 million, is launching a new vertical focused on improving the healthcare system. Julien Méraud, a senior team member of the French unicorn startup Doctolib, is joining the startup studio. As a reminder, Hexa started its life as eFounders and originally focused specifically on B2B software-as-a-service startups. The studio comes up with startup ideas, finds startup founders to pair them with these ideas and helps them get started with its own core team and some initial funding. After a while, startups “graduate” from the startup studio and continue their life as independent companies — with Hexa maintaining a stake in its portfolio companies. Some of Hexa’s past companies include Front, Aircall and Spendesk. As Hexa starts to branch out to other verticals, the startup studio is also rethinking its strategy. For the health vertical, Hexa is not only hiring Julien Méraud, but it’s also going to work with a full-time medical doctor to help when it comes to assessing future projects. For each health tech startup, Hexa will look for two co-founders — a doctor who already knows their speciality and has hands-on experience and an operational founder who knows how to scale companies. Hexa Health will have a vertical approach with each company focusing on one pathology specifically. The first two startups that will come out of the studio will focus on weight loss and skin cancer detection. “The idea is to have a CEO and a CTO — just like in most startups. And that’s quite common across all Hexa companies. But something that’s a bit new with this particular vertical is that we believe innovation in healthcare should be driven by doctors. In other words, if you ask me to design the perfect care to detect skin cancer, I’m not capable of doing it. That’s why we want to work with doctors on every innovation,” Méraud told me. He also insists on the fact that Hexa doesn’t want to disrupt the healthcare industry as a whole. With this new vertical, the startup studio wants to find inefficiencies and improve the care pathways, as there’s a growing imbalance between an aging population in Europe and the available medical time. “Tech shouldn’t just enable faster care. It should also enable better care. And we’re really going to focus on measuring the medical quality of care and everything we create,” Méraud said."
2022-09-29,"GV aims to help build a company that can sniff out disease, literally",Venture,"Alex Wiltschko has what he thinks is a big idea. He wants to build a company that digitizes scent. It’s a natural step for Wiltschko, who has a PhD in neurobiology from Harvard, where he studied how the brain processes odor. He didn’t wind up in this specific group accidentally, he suggests. It owes to a lifelong “obsession with scent and olfaction” that he came to study alongside Sandeep “Bob” Datta, a Harvard professor who has himself long focused on what happens after one’s sensory neurons pick up a scent. The researchers were trying to better understand how the human brain works — including why certain scents are tied to memories. For a long time, too, their area of study was dwarfed by the attention that sight and image processing has received over the years. Then came COVID-19, and with it, far more focus on how taste and smell are processed — and lost. Now the race has begun to better understand and digitize — and even recreate — scent. Indeed, in July, a neurotech startup called Canaery raised $4 million in seed funding to develop a scent-sensing platform. Moodify, another startup that’s working on the digitization of scent, closed an $8 million round of funding last year, including from Procter & Gamble. Wiltschko also sees a big opportunity in solving these unknowns, as does his longtime employer, Google. After logging close to six years with Google AI, Wiltschko just became an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) at GV, the venture arm of the search giant, where, more specifically, he hopes to build a company that can identify disease faster based on specific odor molecules. It’s a meaningful vote of confidence from GV, which has only appointed five life-science-focused EIRs in its 13-year-history, and also incubated Flatiron Health (which went on to sell to the pharma giant Roche in 2018 for $1.9 billion); the gene-editing company Verve Therapeutics, which went public last year; and Rome Therapeutics, a startup that’s developing therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases by focusing on portions of DNA that have been largely overlooked by researchers, it says. (Rome has raised at least $127 million over two rounds of funding so far.) The big question, of course, is what will come of the effort. To learn more about how he’s approaching his mission, we talked yesterday with Wiltschko, who was personable but also reluctant to share too much. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length and clarity. TC: I haven’t come across something like this before. Are you trying to better understand how to build neural networks based on how people process and compartmentalize information about odors? AW: Taking a step back, every time computers got a new “sense,” like to see or to hear, society completely changed for the better, right? When we first learned how to store visual images, in the 19th century, and eventually how to store them on computers in the 20th century, all of a sudden, we could do things like take X-rays. We could do things like store memories [of] the visual world. And we didn’t need painters to do it, everybody could do it. We did it again for hearing; we [could make] music [captured in one location] available to the masses. But computers can’t smell. They have no ability to detect the chemical world [so] we can’t store the really powerful memories that we associate with smell, like the smell of my grandmother’s home. It’s just gone. It only lives in my mind. The smells of people who I love, and of places I’ve been, are completely ephemeral today. We [also] know that diseases have a smell. We know that different wellness and health states have a smell. Plants, when they’re sick or when they’re healthy, smell different. The amount of information that’s out there in the world that we could potentially act on to make our lives longer, make our lives more joyous, grow more food — that’s really only able to happen inside of living things inside of living noses — if we could automate that, we could have a massive and positive impact on society. What applications do you have in mind? I think the north star for me — and I don’t know how long it’s going to take to get there — is that we become capable of smelling diseases earlier to detect diseases earlier than we currently can. There are lots of stories that are out there — lots of anecdotes and various papers — and research has kind of built up a picture to me that we can smell Parkinson’s much, much earlier than we could otherwise detect it; we can smell diseases much, much earlier. And if we could actually build devices that can turn that information into digital representations, then potentially we could catch diseases earlier and learn how to treat them better. How do we know that we can detect Parkinson’s earlier than any other way through scent? There’s not one single slam dunk that we can detect diseases earlier, but there’s a lot of stories that all have their strengths and weaknesses that add up to a clearer picture. For Parkinson’s, there’s a nurse who first reported that she could smell Parkinson’s in her husband before he actually developed it, and they put it to the test. They gathered T shirts that men had worn — half of them with Parkinson’s, half without Parkinson’s — and said, ‘Hey, can you tell which of these T shirts were worn by a person with this disease?’ She got almost all of them except for one, and she said [to the researchers], ‘Actually, I think you’re wrong.’ And that person did end up developing Parkinson’s disease. They took the story further and tried to isolate exactly what it was that she was smelling. And researchers found the exact material being emitted by the body: this waxy substance called sebum that is excreted by cells on your back. And they found the exact molecules that she was smelling. But it was her nose, it was her ability to take an olfactory picture of the world and turn it into a notion of whether or not someone was sick, that preceded all of that. If we can ultimately digitize scent as you suggest, do you have any concerns that odors could be manipulated for certain means — perhaps to make people think that they’re in danger when they aren’t, or safe when they’re in danger? There’s much good that comes from new technologies but also second-order effects that we don’t always think through. It’s definitely important whenever a new area of technology is developed to think through those things, for sure. One area that I think is nascent, it’s not at all clear where it could go, but at least I personally am relaxed by certain scents. I don’t know why. And so I think there’s a lot for us to learn in that space. Have you studied the effects of COVID-19 on sense of smell? Me personally? No. But my former mentors have certainly been looking at this very, very closely. We started a lot of this research into what people think things smell like when COVID was just starting. And we had to be very careful, because people would lose their sense of smell when they got COVID. And if you’re studying what people think things smell like, you need to be very, very careful if folks suddenly become anosmic — that’s the term for having lost the sense of smell. And so we had to develop all kinds of new checks and balances into our research protocols. And now you’ve joined GV with the idea of developing a company. What sorts of resources are available to you? Will you be partnering with some of your former colleagues at Harvard Medical School? I’m assuming you need access to many datasets. What’s wonderful about starting to work on this idea today versus maybe 10 years ago is that the ecosystem of people who are working on olfaction or scent has grown dramatically. And I think the attention that’s being paid to our sense of smell — because now we’re understanding how important it is when we lose it [has fostered a] much richer ecosystem of folks who are working and thinking about olfaction. Are there already companies up and running that are trying to do exactly what you hope to do? It’s a vibrant ecosystem, and there’s lots of folks that are working on different pieces of it. What’s really wonderful about joining GV as an entrepreneur in residence is being able to take the broad view and thinking about how I can have the most impact in the space in digital olfaction. Can you share more about that path? You mentioned Parkinson’s. Is the idea to focus first on being able to diagnose Parkinson’s, then to build around that, or are you taking a multi-pronged approach? Harkening back to the other senses, there’s just 1,000 things you could do if you could take the visual world or if you could take all of sound and store it in a computer and analyze it. Those are the two edges of the sword — there are so many opportunities, so many places to start, [but] on the other hand, you have to focus, so that’s where I spend a lot of my time thinking, what’s the right path specifically to chart towards our north star, which is improving the well being and length of human life? People offer wildly varying timelines when it comes to when we might see artificial general intelligence. Some say it’s five years away. Some say 10 years. Some say 500. What’s your best guess when it comes to how far away we are from digitizing the sense of smell? It took maybe 100 years to digitize our sense of sight. I think we can compress digitizing our sense of smell into a fraction of that. It’s not going to be easy. It’s going to take a lot of work. But now’s a good time to start."
2024-01-10,"Smart molluscs – yes, smart molluscs – could watch our waterways 24/7 for pollution",Biotech & Health,"If the clams could speak, what would they say? Surely we all ask ourselves this question every day. But a French startup is going further, allowing bivalves like clams, mussels and oysters to act as all-natural water quality inspectors. MolluSCAN was showing off its tech this year at CES 2024 in Las Vegas. The company began as a research project some 15 years ago at the University of Bordeaux. CEO and co-founder Ludovic Quinault and his team were looking into monitoring the health of bivalves, a category of marine animals found all over the world in both fresh and salt water. As largely stationary filter feeders, they are quite in tune with their surroundings, and their habits are affected by things like temperature, pollution and so on. Quinault found that a simple, non-invasive sensor attached to the clam or oyster’s shell can monitor everything from feeding to reproduction and stress responses like suddenly shutting or failing to open at the normal time. These in turn are excellent predictors of various qualities in the water, and can act as an early warning system for problems like toxic substances. The mollusc doesn’t know whether it’s closing because of crude oil residue or an algae bloom, but it intuits that the water is unsafe for life and shuts up. In fact, Ludovic has found that they are extremely sensitive to small changes that chemical analysis may not even pick up reliably. That’s one signal among many that can be told by monitoring bivalves, and after more than a decade of research, Quinault and his team are aiming to commercialize the technology, forming molluSCAN in March of 2023. Water quality is of course very important to governments, park rangers and many industries, but the process of sampling and testing it is rarely convenient. It’s usually impractical to put testing apparatus at multiple places in a body of water, so usually people have to go out and collect samples, then bring them to a central location to be analyzed. Image Credits: molluSCAN The molluSCAN-eye system won’t replace traditional water monitoring, but as a living part of the water ecosystem, its health and the health of its surroundings are closely linked. So oysters doing well in one branch of a river but not another, or mussels suddenly snapping shut in some places after a spill — both these are complementary signals to ordinary testing and could also help direct resources to places where they are particularly needed. The system that monitors clusters of animals is totally self-contained and can operate without any maintenance for more than three years, he said. Since their debut last spring, molluSCAN has landed two regular customers and has three more in talks, though they also have over a dozen science-focused installations around Europe. Quinault is hoping that municipalities and natural resource authorities will shell out for the tech as a totally natural, harmless and low-touch way to watch their waterways."
2023-01-10,Peppy secures a $45M Series B to expand its B2B2C health services platform to the US,Venture,"There are some mega-trends playing out across developed-world workforces that startups are picking up on. There’s the digitization of healthcare, the “platforming” of employee services and the macro effects of older employees, combined with the cost of living crisis for new parents. Founded in London in 2018, Peppy offer services around menopause, fertility, pregnancy and early parenthood to a corporate customer base, which then offers it for free to employees. The twist is that those services are largely individualised, with personal video consultations and the like. Peppy was partly lucky and partly prescient: The massive digitization that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic threw employee services like this online, by necessity. Employees using Peppy can access experts via a mobile app, with instant messaging, group chat, video consultations, live events, articles, videos and programs, as well as join communities. Back in 2021 we covered how it had raised a $10 million Series A led round by Felix Capital. It’s now secured funding to expand in the U.S., with a $45 million Series B led by AlbionVC. The round was joined by Kathaka, MTech Capital, Simplyhealth and Sony Innovation Fund. Previous investors Felix Capital, Hambro Perks, Outward VC and Seedcamp also participated. Peppy started out addressing the oft-ignored issue of menopause support as an employee benefit. This was a fairly untapped area, which led it to gaining a lot of growth quite quickly (the global menopause market reached a valuation of $15.4 billion, and is expected to continue growing at 5% annually through 2030, according to some estimates). In the U.S., around 6,000 women reach menopause every day. Peppy now supports endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), conditions that each affect roughly one in 10 women in the U.S. Dr. Mridula Pore, co-founder and co-CEO of Peppy, said in a statement: “We’re on a mission to become a household name across the world and our Series B funding is just the start. We already dominate Europe’s employer-funded gender-based healthcare market.” Peppy clients now include Accenture, Adobe, Canada Life, Disney and Marsh McLennan."
2024-05-01,"Tiger Global-backed Innovaccer in talks to raise $250M in new funding, sources say",Biotech & Health,"Innovaccer, a health tech startup that aggregates patient data across systems and care settings, is in advanced stages of talks with investors to raise as much as $250 million in a new financing round, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The deliberation for the new funding round is ongoing, and the current talks propose a value of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the nine-year-old company, the sources said, requesting anonymity, as the details are private. The company has developed a cloud-based software layer that integrates with existing electronic health record systems used by healthcare facilities. The platform enables the unification and analysis of patient data from various sources, providing healthcare providers with a comprehensive view of their patients’ health status. By tapping its cloud technology and architecture, Innovaccer aims to bring efficiencies and accelerate growth in the healthcare industry, which has been slow to adopt technology compared to other sectors. Innovaccer — which counts Tiger Global, Mubadala, Lightspeed, Dragoneer, Microsoft’s M12 fund, and Steadview Capital among its backers — was valued at $3.2 billion in a funding round it disclosed at the end of 2021. The San Francisco-headquartered startup has raised more than $375 million to date. Talks about some secondary transactions — where existing backers, employees, or the founders directly sell their shares to other investors, as opposed to the startup selling the shares — are also underway, the sources said. The proposed talks for the secondary transactions value Innovaccer at as low as $2 billion, the sources added. According to one source, health system Kaiser Permanente is among those engaging to lead the funding round, which is expected to be split into many tranches. Kaiser Permanente and Innovaccer share a long history; Kaiser is a customer of Innovaccer and has seen many of its executives join the San Francisco-headquartered startup. On Tuesday, Kaiser announced that it had deepened its partnership with Innovaccer to improve the health system’s value-based care services. A spokesperson for Innovaccer denied that the firm was raising a round. Kaiser didn’t respond to a request for comment. A deal could materialize as early as this month, one source said. According to its website, Innovaccer has helped unify more than 54 million patient records, served 96,000 clinicians, and helped save more than $1.5 billion for its customers. The startup’s ARR, at the end of December, stood at nearly $140 million, according to one source. Innovaccer operates on a subscription business model, charging customers based on the number of patients, modules subscribed, and endpoints. The company’s cloud-based platform offers multiple layers of services, including core data, CRM, virtual care, and remote patient care. It differentiates itself by addressing the traditional healthcare system’s lack of information interoperability, deploying a framework with a common language that brings data together and connects different healthcare systems."
2023-12-02,Deal Dive: Betting on beauty fads is big business,Startups,"As a woman in her 20s with an Instagram account, I’ve witnessed the explosive rise and destigmatization of medical spa treatments. From the influencer I ran track with in high school posting promos for lip blushing and fillers, to constantly discussing buying a Groupon for Baby Botox with my friend Emily, these treatments have become a part of regular conversation in a way they haven’t in the past. The underlying medical spa industry has grown rapidly alongside its new popularity, too. Medical spas are projected to be a $30 billion business by 2030, according to a report by Grand View Research. And the American Med Spa Association reports that the number of clinics offering these treatments grew 62% from 2018 to 2022. Investors are starting to take note of this industry. Most of these medical spas — 81%, according to American Med Spa Association data — are independent clinics or small businesses. Private equity firms are starting to circle like vultures seeking out prime candidates for roll-up strategies. Startups are building tech solutions for these small businesses with VCs seemingly eager to back them. So when I saw that RepeatMD, a vertical SaaS company for the medical spa industry, raised a sizable $50 million Series A, I wasn’t surprised. But I did have one question. While I get why investors would want to back a vertical SaaS company — RepeatMD provides a suite of tools, including marketing, online booking and payments — in an exploding industry, the industry itself gave me pause. I was curious how these investors, both in RepeatMD and on the private equity side, were thinking about the risks associated with a sector so reliant on changing consumer trends. The success of these businesses is entirely based on the strength of underlying beauty fads and largely whatever unrealistic beauty standards consumers are currently trying to achieve. In theory, if promoting natural beauty became en vogue, much of the medical spa industry could become irrelevant. I mean, think about it. When was the last time you heard about buccal fat removal? That flooded social media and beauty magazines in December 2022. But now, just a year later, I had to look up the time period in which it was a fad because nobody really talks about it anymore. Do people still get tooth gems? But investors make a strong case that fads aside, the med spa industry isn’t going anywhere. Sarah Kim, a partner at Centana Growth Partners who invested in RepeatMD, said that she isn’t worried about the individual trends having a strong impact on the business, as the overall industry has accelerated in recent years — despite individual trends coming and going. “I think there will always be tailwinds in the aesthetics industry and new innovation,” Kim said. “It’s about understanding what the research is, what the true benefits are, and then staying ahead of that curve.” Jacob Cole, a principal at Full In Partners who led the firm’s investment in RepeatMD, said that while the actual procedures that people are looking for may change with the seasons, it doesn’t change the fundamental shift in the aesthetics and medical spa industry: Younger people are getting procedures and aren’t ashamed to talk about it anymore. “Ten-plus years ago, Botox and the like was something you did in your 50s and were kind of embarrassed about it,” Cole said. “Recently it’s a lot more socialized. Now you get your regular work done and are not ashamed about it.” Another thing that stands out about this industry is the regularity of these treatments. Procedures like Botox are not a one-time thing. Cole added that RepeatMD makes it easier to get customers on a schedule with discounted packages and promos that help lock in this repeat business. Companies that have a subscription-based revenue system are generally easier to underwrite, because revenue tends to be more consistent. In an industry like this that almost requires repeat visits by its customers, revenue inflow could almost resemble a subscription-based model. These medical spa procedures are also more expensive cash-based treatments. Consumers are spending a solid chunk of change every time they get a procedure done, and the fact that RepeatMD allows them to split up payments through a partnership with Affirm allows more access to more potential customers without any insurance wrangling. Despite the higher price tag, aesthetics is a place consumer spending remains strong during tougher economic times. Kim said that historical data backs this up, too. When looking at Botox, there was only a small dip in sales during the great financial crisis. “Having self-confidence and feeling good about yourself is so core to people, it is a category of spend that hasn’t seen a lot of drop-off,” Cole said. While beauty trends may come and go, investors are bullish that consumers will always be seeking out the next one."
2022-12-01,To da moon: Emm aims to innovate on the menstrual cup,Biotech & Health,"Menstrual cups (sometimes known as “moon cups”) have been around since the 1930s, and it’s been a bloody long period since we’ve seen much innovation in that category. Emm just closed a $1 million round of funding to add some smarts. The company adds an applicator and an app tracking feature to help keep an eye on things. We spoke with the company’s founder to learn more about where she sees the market going in the near future. “What drives me is the firm belief that information about your body can make a life-altering difference to your health outcomes. That’s why what we’re doing at Emm is important — we’re addressing health with our sensing platform and we’re also addressing quality of life with product performance. And that combination of innovation in technology with design is magic,” says Emm founder & CEO Jenny Button in an interview with TechCrunch. “My vision for the next generation of consumer health technology makes me the perfect person to run Emm, and it means that my team (who help bring that vision to life) and I are working to deliver meaningful impact in what’s one of the most important sectors in the world.” The Emm and the accompanying app. Image Credits: Emm. The £891,000 round ($1.1 million) came from a mix of angel groups and the government org Innovate UK. The goal of the round is to hire the core team, and work toward broader market validation. The company is currently in a stage of beta testing, and is planning a product launch next year. The company has been working on developing and testing its product for the past two years. Emm isn’t the first smart menstrual cup on the market. Most notably, Looncup took a stab at the market with a Kickstarter project back in 2015, which raised $160,000 or so, and was scheduled to ship its products in 2016. From the backer comments, it appears that the product never shipped, and the last update from the Looncup team was that the company received FDA approval in 2019. Looncup did not reply to a request for a comment for this article. ‘Smart Menstrual Cup’ Looncup Deciphers Your Flow “Our ultimate goal is to progress individual and collective health through new and unique bio-data. And if it all goes to plan, consumers will have access to tools that don’t currently exist that will provide unique insight into how their body is working and their state of health,” explains Button. “This means they’ll be able to manage their healthcare better thanks to this next generation of wearable technology.” Like many businesses, the company had a number of wobbles over the past couple of years, largely due to supply chain disruptions. “My favorite thing about working on Emm is working with a brilliant team of designers, researchers, engineers and scientists who are equally passionate and committed to improving health outcomes,” Button says."
2021-09-09,Breakout ‘CRISPR platform’ company Mammoth Biosciences is officially a unicorn,Biotech & Health,"The CRISPR-based biotech startup Mammoth Biosciences is officially a unicorn, the company says. The billion-dollar valuation comes on the back of a $150 million Series D round led by Redmile Group, with participation from Foresite Capital, Senator Investment Group, Sixth Street, Greenspring Associates, Mayfield, Decheng Capital, Plum Alley and NFX. Combined with a late 2020 Series C round of $45 million (which included participation from Amazon), this brings the company’s total financing to $195 million. Mammoth Biosciences has been a major player in the CRISPR space since its founding in 2017. CRISPR, put simply, is a pair of biological scissors that can cut and replace genes in cells and living organisms, opening up the potential to perhaps permanently cure genetic disease, and perform DNA-based diagnostics. In an increasingly hot biotech market, protecting IP is key One of the company’s four founders is one of the original discoverers of CRISPR, Jennifer Doudna, who recently won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Emmanuelle Charpentier for their 2012 work demonstrating CRISPR could be used to cut DNA. The company’s other co-founders are Janice Chen (CTO), Lucas Harrington (CSO) and Trevor Martin (CEO). There are a handful of other CRISPR-based companies out there, including a number that are already publicly traded. This unicorn milestone stands as a sign that Mammoth’s unique approach to CRISPR could help it distinguish itself in that landscape. “It’s a milestone,” says Ursheet Parikh, the co-leader of Mayfield’s engineering biology investment practice. “I think the company has a long way to go from here. This round and this valuation are just signifying the promise of this stage of what the future will hold,” Parikh says he sees Mammoth as a CRISPR “platform.” Mammoth has been discovering new types of CRISPR systems that could be used to solve specific biological problems. “The best analog is, before you had Intel and Microsoft, if somebody wanted to build a new application, they would have to build a whole new computer function with an operating system,” says Parikh. “You don’t have to build a CRISPR solution from the ground up. You can work with Mammoth to find the right proteins for specific problems.” The CRISPR system most people think of when they hear the phrase is a two-part mechanism called CRISPR/Cas-9. The actual molecular scissors that cut DNA (and allow for the editing to happen) is typically the Cas-9 protein. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of Cas proteins out there that can also cut DNA, and as Mammoth’s leadership argues, can do so even better in the original, depending on the application. Mammoth is creating a “CRISPR toolbox,” or a collection of different Cas proteins. You could think of them as different types of scissors that each have their own specific use cases. In August 2020, for instance Mammoth licensed a family of proteins called the Casɸ family from UC Berkeley. These proteins were discovered by a graduate student team at UC Berkeley, and reported in papers published February 2020 in Nature in July 2020 in Science. This family is an ultra-small version of the typical Cas9 proteins that may make it easier to develop therapies in living people, and could enhance the precision of gene editing. Mammoth has also characterized a Cas14 system, another family of ultra-small proteins that latch on to different target sequences in the genome (like landing pads that tell Cas proteins approximately where to cut) than the Cas9 proteins do. “Mammoth was really founded with this idea that there’s this whole universe kind of a CRISPR that goes beyond the legacy systems like Cas9,” says Martin. The development of a CRISPR toolkit isn’t just interesting science, it’s also a smart business move for Mammoth for another reason: intellectual property ownership. The original CRISPR/Cas9 system has been the subject of a patent battle between the University of California Berkeley and MIT’s Broad Institute, where scientists also discovered CRISPR around the same time. The newer Cas proteins, not part of this patent battle, allow Mammoth to completely sidestep that concern. “The patent disputes that the Broad is involved in concern legacy CRISPR-Cas9 systems. Mammoth’s systems are not Cas9-based, so they are not subject to these disputes,” Martin clarifies. In essence, Mammoth has been building up a collection of proprietary tools that might later be put to use. Though the possibilities are nearly limitless (genetic medicine or CRISPR-based diagnostics), many of these therapeutic products don’t exist quite yet. 2020 was a big year for CRISPR therapeutics due to an influx of new clinical trials, suggesting therapeutics are just beginning to work their way through the regulatory requirements — though approvals are still far off. Companies like CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals have announced promising results from trials on CRISPR-based beta thalassemia and sickle cell treatments. And this summer, Intellia Therapeutics (another company co-founded by Doudna) and Regeneron took the field a step further, showing that CRISPR-based treatments injected directly into the body were useful in silencing a gene that causes ATTR amyloidosis, a disorder where proteins produced in the liver are misfolded (this can lead to complications, like heart failure over time). Mammoth’s niche in the expanding world of CRISPR therapeutics, notes Martin, will be a focus on in-vivo applications (or therapies delivered in the human body), which he argues their CRISPR toolbox may enable. “We don’t have a timeline [for potential products] on the therapeutic side but we’ll definitely be releasing more information over the next few years and we’ve been really excited about the technical results so far,” says Martin. Diagnostics, however, is already an area where Mammoth could distinguish itself sooner rather than later. There, the company is already working with partners to create viable products. In January, Mammoth earned funding through the The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a point-of-care test that could detect up to 10 pathogens at once, and a larger, lab-based test that could detect up to 1,000. Mammoth has also received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program to develop advanced diagnostics using CRISPR, and entered into a partnership with GSK to develop a point-of-care COVID-19 test that could detect viral RNA in about 20 minutes. Mammoth has continued to straddle both worlds of diagnostics and therapeutics, despite “pressure” to fit into one box or the other, says Parikh. The unicorn valuation, he adds, is an additional sign that the company’s technology can operate in both worlds. “I think what this milestone, this round, does, is validate their approach to company building, which was really to focus on an area of expertise, rather than just putting themselves in a box, of diagnostics or therapeutics,” he says."
2024-01-06,"Harvard’s robotic exoskeleton can improve walking, decrease falls in people with Parkinson’s",Robotics,"If you follow the world of robotic exoskeletons with any frequency, you’re no doubt aware of the two primary categories. The first is aimed firmly at workers with strenuous or repetitive jobs such as lifting and transporting packages. The second is assistive, largely focused at individuals with mobility impairments. The latter category is often the domain of soft robotic exoskeletons — those with fabric parts designed to be more of a day-to-day assistive accessory. These systems are also increasingly focused on specific issues that impact people’s ability to get around. After all, not all mobility impairments are created equal. In the case of people with Parkinson’s disease, “freezing” is a frequent issue that impacts the ability to walk, while increasing the likelihood of falls. The symptom causes people to lose their footing while walking, shortening steps before stopping altogether. There have been a number of attempts to tackle the issue, from medication to physical therapy to surgery, but existing solutions are limited in their efficacy. New research from a joint team from Harvard and Boston University, published in Nature Medicine, demonstrates how soft robotic exoskeletons can address the issue. The wearable technology features sensors that detect movement and utilize algorithms to estimate the walker’s gait. Cable-driven actuators kick in, assisting walking midstride. “We found that just a small amount of mechanical assistance from our soft robotic apparel delivered instantaneous effects and consistently improved walking across a range of conditions for the individual in our study,” says Harvard professor Conor Walsh. Researchers worked with a 73-year-old man with Parkinson’s who suffers from freezing more than 10 times a day. In their research, which was carried out over the course of six months, Walsh’s team was able to eliminate freezing in patients while walking indoors. In turn, they were also able to walk farther and faster. Harvard notes, “The effect was instantaneous. Without any special training, the patient was able to walk without any freezing indoors and with only occasional episodes outdoors. He was also able to walk and talk without freezing, a rarity without the device.” The Harvard Biodesign Lab is the same group that designed an exosuit for stroke patients that was subsequently licensed by the startup ReWalk Robotics. If the promising early results are any indication, this new technology could someday follow in its footsteps to commercialization."
2024-07-04,"J2 Ventures, focused on military healthcare, grabs $150M for its second fund",Venture,"J2 Ventures, a firm led mostly by U.S. military veterans, announced on Thursday that it has raised a $150 million second fund. The Boston-based firm invests in startups whose products are purchased by civilians and the U.S. Department of Defense. While many emerging VCs are struggling to raise second funds, J2’s latest vehicle is more than double its $67.5 million debut fund from 2021. At first blush, the firm may seem to be benefiting from VCs’ growing interest in defense tech. But J2 has no interest in positioning itself as a defense tech investor. “Our portfolio is national-security adjacent, but not defense-focused,” said Alexander Harstrick, J2’s managing partner. The firm does not invest in technologies that protect critical national infrastructure or help deter attacks, such as drones, robotics, or surveillance tech. Instead, J2 backs companies whose products help maintain the well-being and healthcare of nearly 3 million people employed by the U.S. military. Harstrick said that the Department of Defense (DoD) has historically adopted new technologies before they became popular with civilians. And it’s not just the internet, which was partially developed by the military. “The Department of Veterans Affairs was the first to use telemedicine,” Harstrick said. “They were also the first to adopt electronic health records.” Disrupt 2024 Got Laid Off?

2024-02-01,Izote Biosciences takes in $2.6M to develop a fermentation process sans oxygen,Biotech & Health,"Using precision fermentation as a manufacturing process to create bio-based products like chemicals, medicines and even cultivated meat continues to be costly and not yet perfected for scalability. Enter Izote Biosciences. The startup is developing a proprietary method that enables bacteria to “breathe without oxygen” inside a bioreactor. And it raised an oversubscribed pre-seed of $2.6 million last October to get it going. The name Izote (pronounced ee-zoh-tay) was inspired by the national flower of El Salvador, where the family of Izote co-founder and chief technology officer Victor Manuel Reyes-Umaña, is from. The technology was initially developed by Reyes-Umaña, who has a background in microbiology and fermentation, and Berkeley professor John Coates. He formed the company in 2022 and brought on Samuel Atwood as co-founder and CEO in February 2023. Atwood worked previously at McKinsey doing management consulting. Atwood explained that Izote’s technology has its origins in synthetic biology, which is editing genomes of different organisms or compounds to create useful inputs. For example, using biotechnology to create therapies or new drugs. It is also being used in the agriculture, food and chemicals industries. Precision fermentation’s capacity craze: Have we lost the plot? The company’s technology enables the making of what Atwood called “bio-based molecules” for a number of industries to yield low-cost, local feedstocks. Izote is using fermentation as its method, but Atwood described it as “a step change from the traditional fermentation process.” The traditional method uses microorganisms engineered to produce specific compounds. These require oxygen to breathe. That means the entire system is designed around making sure the microbes have constant access to the oxygen so they can survive. In turn, that determines what the bioreactor needs to look like, how large it should be and the equipment needed. “The costs of this imposes and complicates your processes significantly,” Atwood said. “Our innovation uses an alternative molecule to oxygen. It resembles salt, and it’s about 100,000 times more soluble than oxygen. Instead of pumping air and mixing your broth, our process involves dissolving the salt into the media, and your organisms will swim toward it.” In this way, bio processes utilizing Izote’s anaerobic organisms can expect to see over 70% lower capital expenditures and gross margins of 50% to 100% higher, he said. And customers just need a simpler bioreactor to get more predictable scaling performance and an ability to extend fermentation runs longer, Atwood said. Izote’s first applications will be in the fragrance and flavor industries, and the company is actively talking to large perfumeries. Future plans include scaling the platform to enable the production of bio-based molecules across industries, like food and cosmetics. Pow.bio says biomanufacturing is broken and its continuous fermentation tech will fix it The company is working on a few projects for customers but is still in the pre-revenue stage. After receiving a small amount of funding last year, Reyes-Umaña and Atwood decided to go after additional venture capital to build a team that could design and execute Izote’s process in a laboratory setting. Embark Ventures and EGB Capital led the pre-seed round and were joined by Bee Partners, FTW Ventures, Nucleus Capital, Courtyard Ventures, Climate Capital Bio and Redstick Ventures. Bee Partners incubated the company, Atwood said. It has raised $2.6 million in total. It will take 18 months to identify what Izote’s launch molecules will be and demonstrate that the molecules can be produced in the lab and at a productivity of at least 50% better than anything currently on the market, Atwood said. “Over the course of the last 10 to 15 years, people have gotten really excited about synthetic biology and that you can make almost anything with microorganisms,” Atwood said. “However, we’ve observed companies start with the product and then assume the economics would follow. That’s been a failure point for this industry. Instead, we’re starting with a molecule, or a set of molecules, where we know from the start the economics at scale are going to be competitive. Then we grow in that way.” Investors salivate over food tech companies perfecting precision fermentation"
2023-05-11,MediShout wants to bring Amazon-like efficiency to hospital operations,Biotech & Health,"The U.K.’s floundering National Health Service (NHS) is not in the best of shapes by just about any estimation, the victim of chronic underfunding and understaffing that has led to excruciatingly long waiting times and healthcare professionals striking en masse. But in the midst of chaos, opportunity often lingers. A growing number of startups are capitalizing on the U.K.’s struggling healthcare system, raising money for platforms that provide access to private medical imaging services, or go some way toward solving staffing shortages. And then there’s MediShout, a London-based company that proclaims to be a “one-stop app” for reporting operational deficiencies in hospitals, allowing staff to track status updates and new orders similar to how one might do with their Uber ride or Amazon order. Founded by Dr. Ash Kalraiya back in 2013, MediShout unifies all help desks and medical suppliers within a single app. It began as a side-project as Kalraiya continued his role as a full-time orthopaedic surgeon; however, Kalraiya brought in doctor Ali Bahsoun as co-founder and chief product officer (CPO) in 2020 to kickstart MediShout as a full-time business. The startup went on to raise £167,000 ($211,000) in angel funding, before closing a £1 million ($1.25 million) pre-seed round of funding from Episode 1 in September, 2020. Kalraiya told TechCrunch that he expects MediShout to be profitable next year, and to spur its next phase of growth it has now raised a further £4.3 million ($5.4 million) in seed funding. MediShout founders Ash (CEO) and Ali (CPO). Image Credits: MediShout ‘Like ordering on Amazon’ Under the hood, MediShout essentially aggregates suppliers, help desks and operational departments, and seeks to supplant incumbent tools such as faxes, emails, paper forms and help desk software (e.g. ServiceNow). “As a surgeon on the frontline, I witnessed operational problems preventing best patient care daily,” Kalraiya said. “Patient care would routinely be delayed or cancelled due to preventable problems like faulty lightbulbs, broken printers or missing equipment.” At a time when healthcare providers are already under significant pressure, equipment failure is an extra burden they really don’t need. For example, a faulty endoscope can take up to nine hours to fix across multiple different members of staff, due in part to the workflows of multiple department and equipment suppliers. This may involve paperwork, phone calls and countless logistical measures to arrange delivery and collection of the device. And this is all before we even consider unexpected hurdles and bottlenecks. “The big issue is not only does staff time get wasted, but often (medical) procedures get cancelled as communication was too slow and devices don’t get returned fast enough,” Kalraiya said. Kalraiya says that in this instance, MediShout can cut the amount of time in half to around 4.5 hours, with all the reports and updates filed digitally through an app and all relevant stakeholders notified automatically. “The supplier sends back messages and status updates in real time which all hospital staff can see,” Kalraiya said. “No paperwork is required, and staff don’t have to call their supplier to chase up. This process is now like ordering on Amazon, where everything is digitized and data can be viewed in real time.” MediShout app. Image Credits: MediShout The main problem that MediShout is looking to solve is that hospitals typically use hundreds of different systems from different suppliers, each with very different processes and approaches to communication — this spans facilities, porters, equipment, sterile services, IT, HR and more. “This makes healthcare ecosystems extremely complex and difficult for staff to navigate, so they can’t provide efficient care to patients,” Kalraiya said. “We solve this issue by providing the world’s first app which unifies all helpdesks, supplier and operational departments.” MediShout’s biggest customers are medical device and facilities management companies, which pay MediShout via a monthly subscription to plug into its platform, which then digitizes and bridges their services for hospitals, most of which are part of the NHS. “One supplier is currently scaling us to more than 100 hospitals in the U.K. and abroad,” Kalraiya said. “We do also sell directly to hospitals, in particular the NHS.” Kalraiya also said that it has some AI work currently in its R&D phase, which — when commercialized — could help predict when future issues may occur. For this, the company can look at, say, all the medical equipment data from hospitals, including details on equipment that has broken over the past 15 years. “Based on usage and repair frequency we started to predict when equipment like ECG (electrocardiography) machines were likely to break down,” Kalraiya said. “You can then do planned maintenance to prevent breakdowns occurring.” MediShout, which has 22 employees today, is currently operational in the U.K. and Ireland, though with its fresh cash injection it’s looking to expand further afield into mainland Europe. “I’ve worked as a surgeon in many countries, and these [operational] problems exist everywhere,” Kalraiya added. MediShoud’s seed round was led by Nickleby Capital, with participation from KHP Ventures, Episode1 and several individuals from Atomico’s Angels program."
2022-11-21,Spain’s Cobee raises $41M for an employee benefits ‘superapp’,Enterprise,"Benefits are one of the great oxymorons of full-time employment: the name implies help and advantages, but in a lot of cases, it’s hard to know what perks and rewards you might have available to you, much less use them on a regular basis. Now a startup called Cobee — which has built a platform and an app to make organizing and accessing these a little easier, a payment card (physical or virtual), and an integration with payroll — is today announcing some funding on the heels of seeing strong interest for its services, with revenues growing 3x this year. The company has raised €40 million ($41 million) in a Series B round of funding co-led by Octopus Ventures and Notion Capital, with participation from previous backers Balderton Capital, Speedinvest and Dila Capital. Cobee is based out of Madrid and its focus currently is on Spain and Portugal, where it has carved out a space providing benefits to companies ranging in size from small businesses to enterprises, with around 800 customers in those countries, including Ogilvy, Booking, Workday, N26, JTI, Job & Talent, Avis, Línea Directa, Michelin, Petronas and Glovo. It will use the funds to expand to other Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking markets in Latin America, starting with Mexico, as well as to other countries in Southern Europe. The round brings the total raised by Cobee to around €60 million (including a seed round we covered just before COVID-19 descended on the world). Borja Aranguren — the CEO who co-founded the company in 2019 with Nacho Travesí — said in an interview that it is not disclosing its valuation. But as a rough guide, there have been a number of other startups looking to rethink how to package up and deliver benefits. Swile out of France raised money from SoftBank last year at a $1 billion valuation; Forma out of the U.S. raised $40 million earlier this year; Chicago’s HealthJoy raised $60 million last month; Perkbox is making waves in the U.K.; Sodexo is coming at benefits from a position as a giant in hospitality; and Brazil has two benefits startups, Caju and Flash, going head to head with each other, with the latter counting investors like Tiger Global among its backers. That selection of companies speaks to the wider competitive field for Cobee, as well as the opportunity and the gap in the market. Benefits and perks together form part of what is meant to attract and retain employees to an organization, but often they also include items that are less optional and just part of what everyone expects or might be required to have from their employer. For example, in some countries, offices are required by law to provide lunch or vouchers for lunch to employees; in some markets, employers provide optional health insurance while in others, it might be the primary way that insurance is provisioned. Some might offer discounts for various services like gym memberships or shopping with certain retailers. Some will provide discounts on professional training courses while others pay for these, but others offer nothing at all. All of this has in most cases all been lumped together behind the basic concept of “benefits” but in a way that’s not that easy to understand, let alone access, not least because the teams that administer these usually deal with multiple suppliers and systems to provision them. Cobee’s service, investors say, stands out in part because it makes dealing with all of that easy for both employers and employees. “What’s unique about Cobee, compared to other players in this space, is their flexible platform, capable of being adapted to different company types and different countries with little friction,” said Itxaso Del Palacio, partner at Notion, in a statement. At the front end, Cobee is based around an app that employees use to browse and select whatever benefits they want to use to activate them. In cases where it involves physical commerce or paying for specific items on the spot, they are then issued with a card that can be used to redeem these. At the back end, these plus whatever benefits are activated without the card (e.g., health insurance plans or training) are calculated and automatically integrated with payroll to come up as monthly deductions on that employee’s paycheck. Users can always see a more itemized list of benefits and what they’re spending in the app. Cobee currently covers benefit programs for meals, transport, nursery, training, gift cards, rent, life and health insurance, and soon a wider package of wellness options that have increasingly become part of the benefit offer (and expectation) from employers. The system is effective, in that it’s getting used regularly, both around daily mandatory benefits and optional ones, said Aranguren. “Almost every user we have uses Cobee every single month,” he said. On average, employees are using their payment cards 10 times per month, a number boosted by the fact that meals and transportation are redeemed with the card. “It’s a lot for a monthly user,” he said. While some industries, like tech, have been hit hard with layoffs, the bigger picture for now seems to be that organizations are still hiring and are trying to attract top talent, and also generally trying to keep those who work productive and not frustrated by little things (and bigger things). For as long as that continues, there will be a focus on making benefits something that works, too — an opening for companies like Cobee. Nick Sando, a principal at Octopus, estimates that the market size for benefits works out to about $53 billion of business spend. “Increased competition and mobility in the job market has transformed employee benefits from a ‘nice to have’ to a ‘need to have’ talent attraction and retention tool,” he said in a statement. “Cobee stands to play a fundamental role in the employee benefits markets by providing both best-in-class service providers and a core platform for HR teams to best manage and distribute these services.”"
2023-08-31,Veterinary software company TeleVet rebrands as Otto amid $43M in fresh funding,Biotech & Health,"Scheduling medical appointments is challenging enough for humans, so Otto, formerly TeleVet, wants to make it easy to, at the very least, care for our pets. The veterinary software company offers a way for clinics to manage aspects of their operations, from schedule to after-hours triage to payments and digital prescription refills. Its practice management system also integrates with platforms vets are already using, including Cornerstone, Neo and AVImark, so that data is complete and accurate. By doing all of that, Otto claims it can free up to eight hours each week for veterinary teams. Zeynep Young, CEO of Otto, joined the company to succeed co-founder Steven Carter in December 2022. She tells TechCrunch that there has been a “huge explosion in the pet population,” however, at the same time, there is a decline in the number of veterinary clinics due in large part to burnout. Even if clinics add more people the problem won’t be solved without technology, she said. “Historically, the veterinary industry has been a bit of a tech laggard and a sleepy industry from an innovation perspective,” Young said. “We’re seeing that really change, obviously. But there’s a lot of room for improvement in terms of helping clinics deal with the expectations of today’s client and to be able to deliver the best healthcare for pets in today’s environment.” There’s where Young believes Otto comes in: by understanding the challenges clinics are facing and developing a tool that will help them succeed instead of disrupting what they do. Pet telehealth company Airvet closes on $18.2M to embark on enterprise focus “14 tabs problem” As I’ve noted previously, there is a growing list of startups, for example, Airvet, Digitail, The Vets, Dutch and Mixlab, working on solutions to help veterinarians. There has even been some recent M&A activity around it. Young sees Otto differentiating itself from the pack by approaching clinics from a partnership standpoint, she said. Instead of throwing point solution after point solution at clinics, Otto aims to be an end solution. “Clinics have what is affectionately known as the ‘14 tabs problem,’” Young said. “They’ve got 14 tabs open in front of them, and they’re trying to skip from one to the other to figure out how to follow an actual patient. That leads to some really thorny problems, like sending an appointment reminder to a pet that’s already been euthanized by the practice. And staff burnout from having to move from solution to solution, as well as disruptions in care and communication.” That approach appears to be working: The company grew its customer base by 600% to over 8,000 new veterinary clinics and hospitals after adding more than 1,000 in the past year. The company also saw the number of appointment no-shows among clinics cut in half and call volume reduced by about 70% as pet parents have been using the automated prompts for routine requests. Meanwhile, Otto added several new features, including a communication platform, called Flow, that includes a payments tool, and Care membership plans. Young declined to go into detail about Otto’s revenue growth, however, she did say that the company is “on track to be at a breakeven point by the end of 2025.” A new name Buoyed by the growth, the company is announcing $43 million in new Series B capital. Mercury Fund, which led the company’s $5 million Series A round in December 2022, is back to lead this new investment. Mercury was joined by existing investor Boehringer Ingelheim and new investor Hill’s Pet Nutrition. The new funding gives Otto $48 million in total venture-backed funding. As part of the investment, Heath Butler, venture partner at Mercury Fund, will join Otto’s board of directors, and Nicki Baty, president and general manager of Hills US, will join as a board observer. And in addition to the new investment, Otto, founded as TeleVet by Carter and Price Fallin, is unveiling its new name. When TeleVet was first launched, it was focused on equine health. Then the global pandemic hit and a portion of the product was able to be used for curbside checking and telemedicine. Since then, TeleVet is associated with a very old functionality that Young said didn’t feel like it represented “the true innovation in the company.” “We’ve moved beyond that,” she noted. “Otto is a name we love because much of our product is about automating those tedious tasks so your staff can focus on the best part of their job, which is to deliver healthcare. It’s friendly and approachable.” Clinical pathways are the currency of health tech"
2024-05-17,IndieBio’s SF incubator lineup is making some wild biotech promises,Biotech & Health,"IndieBio’s Bay Area incubator is about to debut its 15th cohort of biotech startups. We took special note of a few, which were making some major, bordering on ludicrous, claims that could pay off in a big way. Biotech has been creeping out in recent years to touch adjacent industries, as companies find how much they rely on outdated processes or even organisms to get things done. So it may not surprise you that there’s a microbiome company in the latest batch — but you might be surprised when you hear it’s the microbiome of copper ore. I talked with IndieBio’s chief science officer, Wes Dang, about the companies I found most promising or provocative, and he assured me that despite sounding somewhat outlandish, these companies are serious and the IndieBio program does a lot of verification work. “We’re all technical by background, several PhDs, including myself — we do the diligence together. We all look at the papers, and some of us go deep and check the figures and assumptions,” he said. Stream Genomics is perhaps the most easily grasped of the new group: a genome sequencing method and device that is faster and cheaper than runaway market leader Illumina, and more importantly reduces the need for wet-lab prep that still takes a lot of time and expertise. Image Credits: Stream Genomics There are cheaper sequencers out there, but because Illumina is so deeply embedded, the cost of switching is high, especially if you’re only saving money on the sequencing step. Stream Genomics’ approach minimizes sample prep and reagents used (the sequencing isn’t cyclic) while shifting a lot of the computational load to the cloud. They say it’s orders of magnitude quicker and cheaper. “With Stream, you’re just watching the nucleotides incorporate in real time, looking at the colors associated with the As, Ts, Gs, and Cs coming up, and doing it without a huge computational load,” said Dang. “It’s the equivalent of streaming versus download a Blu-ray.” Illumina is too big to be displaced outright, but smaller operations will likely appreciate a faster, less involved option for sequencing than either sending it out to a third party (which can take weeks or months) or building their own sequencing lab (expensive). Another company looking at a potentially huge change is AquaLith, a battery tech startup that claims (we covered them last year) to have figured out a silicon anode material that resists the type of long-term wear and tear that it is usually subject to. The specifics are certainly in the weeds, but the company is planning to sell just the material to battery makers who already have the means to make batteries of this type but need the silicon mixture — “Basically a slurry,” said Dang — which Aqualith makes exclusively. As you can see, the AquaLith thing (right) is smoother.Image Credits: Aqualith Battery startups and alternative chemistries have come and gone for decades, and only a small portion end up being anything but a footnote; however, AquaLith is apparently solving for a very specific problem in an otherwise noncontroversial part of the domain. They have plans to make a nonflammable battery cell soon as well. Here’s hoping it works out. Farm Minerals is starting its journey off with a bit of good old-fashioned stunt advertising: It’s giving away the first million acres’ worth of its synthetic fertilizer for free. “They’re basically doing it as a sort of flex,” said Dang. “It’s just so incredibly cheap to make.” Electron microscope image of the high-surface-area structure of the mineral additive. Image Credits: Farm Minerals Fertilizer is a huge expense for farming and you need tons of it to cover a good-size field. But ultimately crops need only a small amount of the minerals in it — so Farm Minerals is encapsulating those minerals in a special super-bioavailable carbon casing. They say that 160 grams of it is enough for — checks notes — 2 million hectares?! “As a scientist, I was like, no fucking way this works,” Dang said after I offered a similarly blue appraisal. But they looked into it and apparently it does. Also, that means they’re giving away about a cereal bowl’s worth of product for the stunt. Suddenly that part doesn’t seem so wild. That jug in the image above is probably enough to cover the whole country. We’ll follow up with the company soon to see about independent validation of these claims. Image Credits: Transition Biomining Transition Biomining may be the most sci-fi of the companies, trying, as they describe it, “to squeeze life out of a rock.” The issue is this: Only a certain amount of the minerals in raw ore can be easily collected through the physical and chemical processes (already quite extreme and caustic) currently used. What’s better than getting 95% of the copper out of five gigatons of ore? Getting 98% of it. (I’m inventing these numbers.) And if Transition’s method works, someone else will be doing the work: microbes. The company aims to test and understand the microbiome of the rock — that is, the unique set of microbes living in and around it — and modify it so that minerals are being extracted by those microbes just doing their thing. It won’t replace the acid baths and other traditional methods, but it might help make mines more efficient. There are plenty more in the batch. Here’s a brief rundown of the others: Able Sciences: Self-amplifying RNA that lowers the cost of cell therapy. Bryosphere: Treatment for age spots made in a moss cell reactor. Hypercell: Simple, fast food safety testing for industrial packing facilities. Nutrition From Water: Low-carbon whey sourced from aquaculture. SpiralWave: Plug-and-play cold plasma methanol reactor. Reactosome: Gene delivery via a supplementary nucleus (!). Rybodyn: Finds and characterizes unknown proteins from the “dark proteome.” California Organic: Organic ammonia supplier via fermentation. Cereswaves: “Electrofertilizer” that boosts crop and animal growth with energy field (?). Oxyle: Mechanical(ish) PFAS removal from ground and waste water. We’ll want to follow up with these companies as they share more about their progress toward these sometimes mad-sounding ambitions. The San Francisco–based incubator’s demo day will be in June, at which time the companies may have more information to share."
2023-01-03,5 tips for healthcare startups fundraising in a down market,Biotech & Health,"Dr. Galym Imanbayev Contributor Dr. Galym Imanbayev joined Lightspeed in 2020 as a partner focused on the healthcare sector. In fundraising, a founder’s greatest challenge is not selling any particular product or strategy. Instead, it is often unwinding and realigning the investor’s biases. The competition is not your market competitor or incumbent. More often, it is the investor’s set of operating heuristics, many of which are quickly influenced by market conditions. Fundraising in healthcare, especially in a macro environment like the one we’re in, is an opportunity to differentiate and take control of the narrative. When markets start to dip, most companies hunker down and focus on surviving. In moments like these, healthtech companies can take advantage of the status quo getting upset and rise to the top of a crowded field, signaling to the market why they are the horse to bet on. Reframe the macro view When the market seems to be trending downward, it’s an opportunity for founders to take control of the narrative and reframe how investors view market conditions based on a deep analysis of their sector. Broadly compared to other industries, healthcare often remains resilient during times of economic distress. When everything is going well, it’s easy to forget and even easier to underappreciate the acyclicality of the healthcare market as a whole. But a quick look at data from the Bureau of Labor shows that employment in the sector continued to grow during the last recession, a testament to how robust the sector is. While employment may not be a comprehensive barometer for all healthcare activity, the demand for real solutions to real pain points in healthcare will continue to be inelastic. If you’re in services, frame your business around this labor demand; if you’re developing solutions for software, operations and RCM, leverage this growing gap between the need and the adoption of technology. In this environment, funds will be looking for acyclical markets to invest in. This is an opportunity for you to capture this capital pool. Get granular In a market inundated with “digital health” startups and “infrastructure solutions,” it’s vital to differentiate yourself. Move beyond generic labels that no longer tickle the interest of healthcare investors, and instead map out the progression of your company in three acts, from seed to IPO, even if you’re already a late-stage company: For the first act, explain what you are solving and for whom. Dig into the details so investors are convinced that no one understands the problem and the solution better than you. In the second act, communicate which markets or functionalities you can expand to. How does this cross the chasm from early adoption to markets that can provide venture-level returns? For the final act, defend what makes your idea a $10 billion company. How can one investment turn into a fund returner for the investor you are pitching to? Too many founders focus on midstage expansion but they give neither the level of detail necessary to explain Act 1 nor the clarity of vision that you get with Act 3. When a founder intimately understands the problem, that’s half the journey to success, because as an investor, I know I can trust the solution being developed. Be dynamic with runway Downturns instinctually motivate most founders to preserve cash at the cost of growth, but this kind of approach is too simplistic. Roadmaps that were designed in stronger markets may no longer be relevant, so founders must proactively manage how these changes shift preexisting go-to-market strategies and product build orders. Remember that it is possible to both reduce and grow headcount at the same time. Doing so in different parts of an organization is neither easy in strategy nor execution, but through detailed scenario planning, you can get to a point where decisions are based less on emotion and more on core KPIs. I encourage all of my portfolio companies to devise base, downside and upside cases, each with clear market signals that would set in motion a variety of budgets to weather the storm or set sail. Threading this needle requires a multivariable set of quantitative analyses and qualitative signals from the market, but it will elevate the conversation between founders and investors to dynamic runway scenario planning instead of just worrying about static cash preservation. Know the difference between dilution and tactical dilution Be wary of optimizing for tactical dilution — the terms at one specific financing — at the expense of cumulative dilution, which encompasses the effect of all rounds. When evaluating terms, analyze them from a cumulative perspective across the current and next two rounds. The best tactical dilution for one round will not necessarily lead to an optimal outcome for the founder. For example, all else being equal, the dilution from taking 20% more capital in a round will be offset by a 25% higher pre-money valuation in the next round. In other words, if an additional 20% cash in a round gets you more than 25% more traction for valuation, it will be the more optimal choice for founders. This is a founder-specific decision, but it’s important to view these choices from a cumulative dilution, multiround perspective. Considering there will be decisions as important as option pools, board governance and runway, being a few inches off at the foundation in exchange for slightly less dilution can lead to meaningful consequences at the top. Remember this is a multishot game If entrepreneurs and investors treat every interaction as a one-shot game, we will all eventually lose trust. Your reputation among your employees, customers and investors will follow you to your next enterprise. It’s important to remember why we are all in this business in the first place: to change the healthcare industry for the better, with the ultimate goal of helping people. If you infuse the humanity of this mission into your investor interactions and business strategy, you will be primed to succeed. I’ve seen how building human-first relationships can create hope for patients as well as financial success. We first started working with Roland and Ben Buelow at antibody company Teneobio, for which we led the Series A round in 2016. Following an acquisition by Amgen, Roland and Ben went on to build another company, Ancora Bio, and we again invested as a co-lead. The Buelows’ consistency of vision, technical and strategic execution, patient-centered orientation and quality of relationships with investors and big pharma alike drove our continued partnership. These suggestions will help you control the narrative in this market and present a sophisticated approach to managing deal expectations and investor interactions. Investors who are nimble, eager to learn and build true partnerships with founders will resonate with these approaches regardless of market conditions."

2023-03-14,India’s HealthPlix raises $22M to accelerate growth and enhance healthcare delivery,Biotech & Health,"HealthPlix, an Indian startup offering its in-house platform for doctors to help record patient data digitally, has raised $22 million in fresh investment to broaden its reach in the country and allow more doctors to utilize its software to offer improved care to their patients. In India, roughly 300,000 doctors practice medicine regularly. However, this figure appears minuscule compared to the country’s rapidly expanding population. This has resulted in doctors not finding enough time to adequately assess each patient. HealthPlix wants to solve this problem through its platform, which is available in a freemium model. The Bengaluru-based startup lets doctors create a 360-degree medical profile of their patients that can be helpful during consultations and for treating chronic diseases. The platform also offers a collective intelligence to doctors that helps them understand characteristics such as what diseases are cropping up in what areas and what treatment regimens are being used by different patients and doctors. “We help doctors diagnose diseases earlier than otherwise they would by being their true assistant,” said Sandeep Gudibanda, co-founder and chief executive of HealthPlix, in an interview with TechCrunch. Founded in 2014, the startup has already empowered more than 10,000 doctors who treat 2.5% of the country’s entire population using the proprietary software. It aims to serve over 25,000 doctors by 2024 and reach 50,000 by 2025 to treat nearly 15% of the Indian population. Of the total number of doctors on board, 70% are outside metro cities, HealthPlix said. Gudibanda said HealthPlix handles a volume of 110,000 patients per day and has facilitated over 70 million consultations to date. The platform reaches about 334 towns in 28 states across the country. Although the market of electronic medical record (EMR) platforms in India has a number of players that all claim to help doctors treat their patients efficiently, HealthPlix believes that its doctor-first approach gives it an edge over the competition. “Every time you make a decision, whether it’s a small feature, a revenue opportunity, whether you build a tech stack or any decision you’re making, are you putting doctors first?” asked Chaitanya Raju, executive director at HealthPlix. The startup targets doctors who own clinics and look for new-age solutions to enhance efficiency. This helps them get a wider reach as the country’s healthcare primarily is undertaken in small clinics and nursing homes instead of at large-scale hospitals, where Indian patients typically visit when their symptoms and illness have gotten worse. Alongside giving a digital solution for keeping patient history and consultations, HealthPlix uses AI to make it easier for doctors to write prescriptions and search for appropriate medicines and diagnoses. The AI deployment also speeds up identifying patients based on their medical data and helps define critical elements that may be relevant for the patient or help the doctor during the treatment. HealthPlix lets doctors write a long prescription of, say, 100 characters with just eight clicks instead of writing those characters manually, said Raju. Additionally, the platform offers translation of prescriptions to let patients easily understand what their doctors have prescribed them. Approximately 60% of the prescriptions processed by HealthPlix are originally written in English by doctors. However, once printed, the prescriptions are automatically translated into the patient’s local language, Gudibanda said. All the data available on the software is fully encrypted, and the startup’s modeling is only on anonymized data, Raju said. The Series C round, led by Avataar Venture Partners and SIG Venture Capital, is divided into $20 million raise against equity and $2 million in debt. It also saw participation from existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, JSW Ventures, Kalaari Capital, Blacksoil Capital and Chiratae Ventures. “We have seen many business models that have failed to scale in the health-tech ecosystem, and we believe that Sandeep has built a great team to deliver on HealthPlix promise,” said Mohan Kumar, investment advisor to Avataar Venture Partners, in a prepared statement. HealthPlix looks to utilize 80% of its fresh funding to grow the doctor base and invest more in sales, product and engineering teams. Currently, the startup has a headcount of 392 people. It will also invest in clinical decision support to help doctors treat the patients better. Moreover, it plans to explore a couple of models to explore how it can disrupt the insurance and the payer side, Gudibanda said. “We invested in HealthPlix to help further the team’s vision of being the active catalyst for technology adoption in healthcare by allowing doctors to be more productive, thereby driving better outcomes for patients,” said Bhavani Rana, investment advisor, SIG Venture Capital. Gudibanda said the startup’s revenues grew 3.5x over the last year and are expected to rise 2.5x to 3x next year. So far, HealthPlix has raised about $36 million. The valuation after the latest funding was not disclosed."
2022-10-27,Navina secures $22M to process and summarize medical data for clinicians,Biotech & Health,"Navina, a company developing AI-powered assistant software for physicians, today announced that it raised $22 million in Series B funding led by ALIVE with participation from Grove Ventures, Vertex Ventures Israel and Schusterman Family Investments. Bringing the startup’s total raised to $44 million, inclusive of a grant from the Israeli Innovation Authority, the proceeds will be put toward product development and widening Navina’s footprint to home, virtual and urgent care, CEO and co-founder Ronen Lavi told TechCrunch. Navina was founded by Ronen Lavi and Shay Perera, who previously led the Israel Defense Forces’ AI lab, where they say that they built AI “assistant” systems for analysts suffering from data overload. Their work there inspired the products they went on to built at Navina, which aim to help physicians drowning in medical data. “The funding comes at a pivotal time for the U.S. healthcare industry on the heels of the pandemic, when physician burnout is at an all-time high,” Lavi told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Navina’s platform is uniquely able to put exactly the right patient information in front of physicians at the right time to give them a deep understanding at a glance, along with actionable insights at the point of care.” Several startups — and incumbents, for that matter — are developing AI assistant technologies for clinical settings. For example, there’s Suki, which raised $20 million to create a voice assistant for doctors, and Bot MD, an AI-based chatbot for doctors. Lavi claims that Navina is distinguished by its ability to “understand the complex language of medicine,” including non-clinical data. Trained on a dataset of imaging notes, consult notes, hospital notes, procedures and labs curated by a team led by medical doctors, Navina’s AI systems integrate with existing electronic health records software to identify potential diagnoses and quality and risk gaps requiring attention. Navina.ai uses AI to process and summarize medical records data. Image Credits: Navina “Navina differentiates in the way it structures and organizes data specifically for primary care physicians at the moment of care,” Lavi said. “Navina fits into existing workflows and familiar tools, meeting physicians and staff where they are … Its goal is to align workflows to effectively serve patient populations and improve value-based care.” One point of concern for this reporter is Navina’s diagnostic capabilities. While perhaps helpful, medical algorithms have historically been built on biased rules and homogenous datasets. The consequences have been severe. For example, one algorithm to determine eligible candidates for kidney transplants puts Black patients lower on the list than white patients even when all other factors remain the same. In response to a question about bias, Lavi said that Navina takes steps to “address health inequities and bias” and “ensure high accuracy of data sets and models.” He added that the company is compliant with HIPAA requirements and underwent a third-party privacy audit, and is in the “final stages” of SOC2 certification. With “thousands” of clinicians and supporting staff using the platform, Lavi says he doesn’t anticipate the economic downturn significantly impacting Navina. He demurred, however, when asked about the company’s revenue and precise customer count. “The pandemic gave Navina and other health tech companies a boost as it required both patients and physicians to grow accustomed to new modalities of care, such as telemedicine and remote visits,” Lavi said. “This has led traditional primary care providers to look for solutions that can help them take responsibility for their patients no matter where they enter the health system.” Navina has 65 employees currently. It expects to end the year with around 75."
2023-10-18,"Allara, a telehealth platform for women with chronic hormonal conditions, raises $10M Series A",Startups,"Chronic hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis are common in women, but also commonly go undiagnosed or inadequately treated. Allara, a New York–based telehealth startup, wants to help connect women with conditions like these with qualified medical practitioners and registered dietitians via its platform. PCOS is one of the most common causes of female infertility, affecting as many as 5 million women, or 1 in 10 of reproductive age in the U.S., according to the CDC. Moreover, about 10% of women across the globe, which is equivalent to 176 million, have endometriosis. Despite how widespread these conditions are, patients with chronic hormonal disorders often undergo years of suffering before receiving treatment, and “up to 70% of cases are undiagnosed worldwide,” per the World Health Organization. Allara CEO and founder Rachel Blank experienced firsthand how challenging it is to get adequate support for PCOS; she was diagnosed with it at 21, after years of unexplained medical issues. “I sought support from various doctors and specialists, did my own research, and played whack-a-mole with lifestyle changes, but wasn’t able to find effective and holistic care for my condition,” Blank told TechCrunch. “There is no FDA-approved treatment for this widespread, chronic condition.” Allara hopes to change that with its comprehensive approach and care team that includes OB-GYNs, women’s health nurse practitioners, endocrinologists and registered dietitians who deeply understand hormonal and metabolic care. Dr. Heather Huddleston, chief medical advisor of Allara and director of the PCOS clinic at the University of California, San Francisco, leads Allara’s expert advisory board. The two-year-old startup said it has raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Google Ventures with participation from Great Oaks Venture Capital, Humbition, Vanterra, Gaingels and angel investors like One Medical founder Tom Lee and Maggie Sellers. Google Ventures’ general partner Frédérique Dame will join Allara’s board of directors. The new money brings its total capital raised to $17.5 million. Blank has worked in digital health since 2018 and was formerly director of strategy at health tech startup Ro. Allara’s virtual care platform offers a monthly subscription service that enables patients to access ongoing medical, lifestyle, nutrition, and emotional support for hormonal, metabolic and gynecological conditions and helps them see improved health outcomes. The startup claims that 75% of patients start to feel better within one month of working with Allara. Since the launch, Allara has expanded “from specialized PCOS care to comprehensive care services for women with hormonal, metabolic and gynecologic conditions,” Blank said. Former Ro director launches Allara, a care platform for PCOS Over the past year alone, the startup’s patient base grew fivefold, and it partnered with major insurers, including Cigna, Anthem, Aetna, Empire and United Healthcare, in eight states, covering approximately 30 million lives to provide quality care for women nationwide. The Series A proceeds will help Allara extend its insurance coverage, launch partnerships with health systems to continue patient care, conduct clinical research and scale its operations for further care, which currently includes research-backed supplements and mental health services based on patient requests. Rachel Blank, the CEO and founder of Allara. Image Credits: Allara When asked about its partnerships with the health system, Blank said, “Allara was not built to compete with the traditional health system, but to help close a massive care gap that exists for women’s health.” The company is in talks with health systems and large fertility groups “to help improve access to chronic care and pre- and post-op management, delivered virtually — rather than requiring patients to visit multiple providers and put their care together themselves. Allara’s platform “allows these health systems and highly specialized providers to focus more on the procedures that need to be done in person.” “The health system often views women’s healthcare as limited to pregnancy and fertility, but many women deal with chronic, specific conditions that require a whole-body, preventative approach,” Blank said. “Our patients are often in their 20s and 30s and looking to improve their overall health or are a few years out from conception and trying to get a head start on improving their health and fertility.”"
2022-10-27,HealthJoy raises $60M to make benefits easier to navigate,Biotech & Health,"Healthcare benefits are great, but navigating them often isn’t. HealthJoy wants to make the experience more seamless for employees, while helping HR departments reduce the number of underutilized benefits. The Chicago-based company announced today it has raised $60 million in Series D funding, led by Valspring Capital with participation from Endeavour Vision and CIBC Innovation Banking. Returning investors U.S. Venture Partners, GoHealth founders Brandon Cruz and Clint Jones, Health Velocity Capital, Nueterra Capital and Epic also joined the round. TechCrunch last covered HealthJoy when it raised its Series C. The latest funding brings its total raised to $108 million. Co-founder Justin Holland told TechCrunch that HealthJoy’s client base has doubled to more than 1,000 employers, covering more than 500,000 employees and dependents, since its Series C funding. It integrates with every benefit in an employer’s package (including medical, dental, vision, savings accounts, clinics and wellness initiatives) and has a live 24/7 concierge. The platform expanded its virtual care suite to be more comprehensive, including a partnership with telemedicine provider Teladoc, which Holland says is an example of how HealthJoy is helping HR and brokers deal with additional major claim categories like cancer and cardiometabolic disease by making it easier for people to get preventative care. “Our belief is access has to be simple and seamless for employees to drive engagement,” he said. HealthJoy also introduced a new feature called “automated steerage” that guides members to lower cost and more efficient solutions in the app. In addition to Teladoc, it also has partnerships with services for medical and prescription claims, utilization management data and virtual care resolutions. “As we continue to invest in data partnerships, we’re building out a comprehensive member profile and engagement engine. That will enable us to engage members earlier and more often in the course of their healthcare journey,” Holland said. “Ideally, we are able to be more proactive than reactive to their personal needs.” HealthJoy sees a 60% activation rate after 30 days and 25% of its employee base logs into its app every month. “When we have the engagement, we use technology to drive utilization across all benefits. We know that members have healthcare needs, but they don’t always think about how their benefits programs can support these needs,” Holland says. An examplee of how HealthJoy helps them find these benefits includes virtual assistant tech that automatically guides members to online options when they’re looking for the doctor. It also helps them compare costs for treatments and procedures when recommending providers and facilities, which Holland says saves members on average $2,000 in out-of-pocket costs. In a statement, Aneesha Mehta, co-founder of Valspring and a former partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said, “As users of healthcare technology ourselves, we genuinely identified with a core issue that HealthJoy fights: a serious lack of benefits awareness that leads to under-utilization by employees. Offering a solution that simplifies benefits is a key differentiator in the talent war the market currently finds itself in. We look forward to amplifying HealthJoy’s solutions as we’ve seen the value they bring firsthand.” As companies fight to retain talent, employee-benefits startups might escape cost cuts"
2023-11-03,Blackbird invests in Carepatron’s ‘radically accessible’ healthcare management platform,Biotech & Health,"When TechCrunch covered Carepatron’s pre-seed last year, the startup was focused on serving solo practitioners and small health practices. Now the healthcare management system has scaled along with its clients, and works with medical practices that range in size from five to 100 practitioners. The platform is now used in about 50 countries and recently launched in Spanish. To support its expansion, Carepatron has raised $4 million in seed funding from Blackbird and TQ Ventures. The New Zealand-based startup says its product’s users are growing 21% month-over-month to tens of thousands of healthcare teams. Its main markets include the United States, where half of Carepatron’s clients are based, and Europe. While many of its clients are physicians, they also include a wide range of providers, like psychologists, physiotherapists, health coaches, life coaches and dietitians. Carepatron was founded in 2021 by David Pene and Jamie Frew, who both have close connections to the healthcare industry. Frew’s family ran a community hospital, while Pene’s partner is a doctor. Carepatron’s platform has tools for providers to manage their entire practice, including appointments, telehealth consultations, patient records, payments and communicating with other providers in a secure environment. It also has a patient app that lets users see their health records and talk with their providers who use Carepatron. Over the last 12 months, Carepatron released a lot of new features, Frew tells TechCrunch, including full customization. Frew says that even though practitioners around the world work in different ways, traditional healthcare software is usually built with a very specific vertical in mind — for example, for psychologists in California. But Carepatron’s goal is for any provider in the world to be able to use it. One example of its customizability is the ability to create different fields, labels and categories for patient-client records. The next step for the startup is to aggregate data from different kinds of providers around the world and use that to create customized workspaces for them. Members of Carepatron’s team. Image Credits: Carepatron “Imagine you’re starting a new business as a health coach in regional Philippines. You come onto Carepatron, you sign up. We know what health coaches look like in the regional Philippines,” says Frew. “We know the kinds of fields and workspace structure they have. Imagine being able to answer a couple of questions and then spinning up a whole workspace.” Carepatron also released a note-taking feature in the form of a block-style editor, which means practitioners can embed videos, prescriptions and anything else they want into their notes. Another feature is automated workflows. For example, if a client visits a practitioner’s website, they can book an appointment on it and all appointment reminders, invoices and payment processes are automatically generated from there, reducing administrative work. The startup’s user acquisition strategy is entirely product-led, says Pene, and the majority of their users came to Carepatron through word-of-mouth referrals. Another part of its growth is its user community features, which Pene and Frew compare to Sigma, Canva and Notion. Practitioners can build resources and tools inside the platform, including assessments, forms and templates, and share them publicly, generating more engagement as other practitioners use them. Pene says about 70% of Carepatron’s new clients switch over from spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets, or a combination of single-feature products. For example, they might use Zoom for telehealth calls, a calendar for online scheduling and Google Workspace for notes and client records. Carepatron’s features can replace all of those. The other 30% used older practice management platforms like Practice or Jane App. Carepatron’s competitive advantages include more affordable pricing and features designed for how new healthcare practices work, Pene says. “If you’re a modern healthcare professional, you’re utilizing things like video calling, utilizing modern technology and their workflows really don’t work that way. The way the systems are architected have a high degree of friction with today’s services and ultimately, [clients] hack those solutions or use workarounds. Or they stay in Excel and have people doing manual work to hand off information.” The new funding will be used on growing Carepatron’s user community. It will also develop its AI and automation capabilities, with plans to hire additional staff to support that plan. “The vision for Carepatron is to build a radically accessible platform that moves from this era of digitalizing the work that healthcare practitioners do, and moves into an era where their system is able to automate or do that work for practitioners,” says Frew. “For a long time in healthcare, we’ve taken stuff that happened in the real world and moved it into a digital format. But we haven’t really added value or fundamentally reimagined the things that people are doing on a daily basis. The vision behind Carepatron is to create building blocks for practitioners to achieve that on a local level.” 10 years since the term ‘unicorn’ was coined, we’ve almost come full circle"
2023-07-19,"Intel Capital, Khosla lead $27M investment into SiPhox Health’s at-home blood-testing tech",Biotech & Health,"Six out of 10 Americans are living with a chronic disease, but access to convenient and low-cost health testing isn’t always available for patients, and bottlenecks still exist with current testing approaches. SiPhox Health wants to change that through more advanced blood testing using silicon photonic chip technology to put a lab-grade health testing device in every home. This is the semiconductor technology that transformed internet connectivity. MIT scientists Diedrik Vermeulen and Michael Dubrovsky started the company in 2020 and were part of the Y Combinator summer cohort that year. At the time, the Burlington, Massachusetts–based company was developing a circuit board for optical chips with a goal of replacing refrigerator-sized diagnostic machines with a tiny chip. Its first product was a $1 COVID-19 test on a disposable cartridge. CEO Vermeulen explained that other at-home blood-testing technologies focused on the paper strip and other collection methods that are the less expensive components, rather than on the testing device. SiPhox Health, instead, started with the more expensive side — the lab instrument. “Our approach is to miniaturize all the components onto silicon chips,” he told TechCrunch. “Silicon photonics technology leaves the instrument completely untouched, so we inherit all the functionality, multiplexing capability, sensitivity and so on, and bring that to the consumer.” And, rather than rely on one blood test per year to assess someone’s health, SiPhox Health enables patients and their doctors to get lots of data points to better help make real-time health decisions. The company offers a test kit and tests for 17 biomarkers, essentially your basic panel, in the areas of inflammation, cardiovascular health, metabolic fitness and hormone balance. Sold on a subscription basis, kits are $95 with a monthly membership of $16 that includes perks like access to continuous glucose monitors and personalized biohacking tools. Big Tech corporate venture capital 🤝 generative AI startups Currently, it is running the tests using mail-in samples and conventional technology. It is working on the development of an at-home device, but it is not on the market yet, Dubrovsky said in an interview. The price of its future offering, which will include the SiPhox Home product, will be subscription-based at less than $100 per month, the company said. SiPhox Health is working toward getting the SiPhox Home product through U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in the next year. The platform will offer proteins and hormone tests from a finger-prick blood sample, with results in five minutes or less. The company is gearing up to do a case study on this with thousands of people. The diagnostic market has made a big shift to at-home, driven by companies like Everlywell and supplemented by startups all over the world, including Oova, Simple HealthKit, Senzo, Healthtracka, TBD Health, Starling Medical and Hormona, which have attracted venture capital attention in recent years. SiPhox Health’s work is also being boosted by a $27 million round of funding that includes $10 million in seed and $17 million in new Series A capital. The Series A round, which closed recently, was led by Intel Capital with participation from Khosla Ventures, Kortex Ventures, Alumni Ventures, Metaplanet, Shorewind Capital, LongeVC, Overlap Holdings and Duke Capital Partners. Khosla Ventures and Y Combinator co-led the seed investment that also included Metaplanet, Massachusetts Manufacturing Innovation Initiative, Rsquared, Vituity, Paul Buchheit, Balaji Srinivasan, Bob Lee, and Longevity Tech Fund. This is what the SiPhox Home at-home test kit will look like when it’s launched. Image Credits: SiPhox Health The Series A funding will also enable SiPhox Health to expand its team of 30 people in the areas of biology, scientists, engineers and mechanical engineers and expand its current business offerings. “We’re currently growing exponentially, from when we initially started to learn about the market and blood testing,” Dubrovsky said. “We are now finding early signs of chronic diseases, like pre-diabetes, in about 20% of all the tests we run.” Meanwhile, with the investment in SiPhox Health, Intel Capital remains a busy corporate venture capital firm lately, investing in Figure earlier this week and recently in AI-enabled sensing tech company MatrixSpace and data workflow automation company Alkymi. As part of the investment, Intel Capital managing director Srini Ananth joins SiPhox Health’s board of directors. “The rapid growth in telehealth and home health sectors necessitates a new paradigm in diagnostics. SiPhox Health’s fast and accurate at-home testing is poised to change the patient journey for employers, pharma, insurers and health systems,” Ananth said in a written statement. “Investments in silicon photonics over the past two decades for the datacom and telecom industry have enabled the massive scaling of the internet and cloud computing. This has set the stage for startups like SiPhox to apply silicon photonics technology to new frontiers. We are highly impressed with their technology and approach to tackling this opportunity.” Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?"
2021-02-25,Foresite Capital raises $969 million fund to invest in healthcare startups across all stages of growth,Biotech & Health,"Health and life science specialist investment firm Foresite Capital has raised a new fund, its fifth to date, totaling $969 million in commitments from LPs. This is the firm’s largest fund to date and was oversubscribed relative to its original target according to fund CEO and founder Dr. Jim Tananbaum, who told me that while the fundraising process started out slow in the early months of the pandemic, it gained steam quickly starting around last fall and ultimately exceeded expectations. This latest fund actually makes up two separate investment vehicles, Foresite Capital Fund V, and Foresite Capital Opportunity Fund V, but Tananbaum says that the money will be used to fuel investments in line with its existing approach, which includes companies ranging from early to late stage, and everything in between. Foresite’s approach is designed to help it be uniquely positioned to shepherd companies from founding (they also have a company-building incubator) all the way to public market exit — and even beyond. Tananbaum said that they’re also very interested in coming in later to startups they missed out on at earlier stages of their growth, however. Image Credits: Foresite CapitalImage Credits: Foresite Capital “We can also come into a later situation that’s competitive with a number of hedge funds, and bring something unique to the table, because we have all these value-added resources that we used to start companies,” Tananbaum said. “So we have a competitive advantage for later-stage deals, and we have a competitive advantage for early-stage deals, by virtue of being able to function at a high level in the capital markets.” Foresite’s other advantage, according to Tananbaum, is that it has long focused on the intersection of traditional tech business mechanics and biotech. That approach has especially paid off in recent years, he says, since the gap between the two continues to narrow. “We’ve just had this enormous belief that technology, and tools and data science, machine learning, biotechnology, biology, and genetics — they are going to come together,” he told me. “There hasn’t been an organization out there that really speaks both languages well for entrepreneurs and knows how to bring that diverse set of people together. So that’s what we specialized in and we have a lot of resources and a lot of cross-lingual resources, so that techies that can talk to biotechies, and biotechies can talk to techies.” A life sciences firm run by a top VC and a cofounder of Alphabet’s life sciences arm, just raised its biggest fund yet Foresite extended this approach to company formation with the creation of Foresite Labs, an incubation platform that it spun up in October 2019 to leverage this experience at the earliest possible stage of startup founding. It’s run by Dr. Vik Bajaj, who was previously co-founder and chief science officer of Alphabet’s Verily health sciences enterprise. “What’s going on, [over the] last couple decades, is that the innovation cycles are getting faster and faster,” Tananbaum said. “So at some point the people that are having the really big wins on the public side are saying, ‘Well, these really big wins are being driven by innovation and by quality science, so let’s go a little bit more upstream on the quality science.’” That has combined with shorter and shorter healthcare product development cycles, he added, aided by general improvements in technology. Tananbaum pointed out that when he began Foresite in 2011, the time horizons for returns on healthcare investments were significantly longer and at the outside edge of the tolerances of venture economics. Now, however, they’re much closer to those found in the general tech startup ecosystem, even in the case of fundamental scientific breakthroughs. CAMBRIDGE — DECEMBER 1: Stephanie Chandler, Relay Therapeutics office manager, demonstrates how she and her fellow co-workers at the company administer their own COVID tests inside the COVID testing room at Relay Therapeutics in Cambridge, MA on Dec. 1, 2021. The cancer treatment development company converted its coat room into a room where employees get tested once a week. All 100+employees have been back in the office as a result of regular testing. Relay is a Foresite portfolio company. Image Credits: Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesImage Credits: Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe / Getty Images “Basically, you’re seeing people now really look at biotech in general in the same kind of way that you would look at a tech company,” he said. “There are these tech metrics that now also apply in biotech, about adoption velocity [and] other things that may not exactly equate to immediate revenue but give you all the core material that usually works over time.” Overall, Foresite’s investment thesis focuses on funding companies in three areas — therapeutics at the clinical stage, infrastructure focused on automation and data generation, and what Tananbaum calls “individualized care.” All three are part of a continuum in the tech-enabled healthcare end state that he envisions, ultimately resulting in “a world where we’re able to, at the individual level, help someone understand what their predispositions are to disease development.” That, Tananbaum suggests, will result in a transformation of this kind of targeted care into an everyday consumer experience — in the same way tech in general has taken previously specialist functions and abilities, and made them generally available to the public at large."
2023-07-11,Proclaim raises $15M so you can pressure-wash your mouth,Hardware,"We all know the importance of good oral hygiene (you do brush twice a day, don’t you?), but despite its obvious impact on our mouths as well as our overall health, there hasn’t been a whole heap of innovation when it comes to teeth. We brush. We floss. We use interdental tools. We use mouthwash. Proclaim is hoping to change that with its Custom-Jet Oral Health System, and it just raised $15 million in Series B funding to help bring it to the world. “Oral care has not fundamentally changed beyond brushes, picks and manually flossing with string (or water) in centuries,” said Heberto Calves, Proclaim’s CEO, when speaking to TechCrunch. “We’re changing all that in a big way.” Proclaim’s Custom-Jet Oral Health System looks a bit like a SCUBA diver’s mouthpiece, but instead of being hooked up to an air tank, it’s connected to a “hydro station” so that it can pulse 60 jets of pressurized water into your mouth over the course of seven seconds. Each mouthpiece is 3D printed according to an individual’s mouth, with the aim of directing the plaque and bacteria-shifting fluid to exactly where each person needs it according to their anatomy. Custom-printed mouth pieces mean that the 60 water jets go where you need ’em. Image Credits: Proclaim Proclaim isn’t intended to replace brushing, but to work in conjunction with it. It claims that using its jet system alongside your regular brush is clinically proven to be 10 times more effective for reducing gum bleeding, nearly 13 times more effective for reducing gum inflammation and almost eight times more effective in reducing plaque buildup when compared to daily brushing and string flossing. Overjet sinks its teeth into another round of capital for its dental AI tech While good oral health is important in and of itself, Calves believes that Proclaim has a part to play in improving people’s general health too: “We can help people live healthier for longer by addressing an everyday problem that underlies much bigger, painful and expensive public health problems,” said Calves, “including heart disease, arthritis, diabetes and dementia (to name just a few). We provide an unbelievably effective, easy to use and enjoyable solution to reduce harmful bacteria throughout the body, starting with gum disease.” Speaking more specifically about the fundraise, Calves explained what it will unlock: “Our goal with this fundraise is to provide the necessary capital for the initial commercialization of Proclaim, setting the stage for a growth C round in Q3 2024,” said Calves. “Our next steps are to begin scaling the business as we drive awareness and education among dental professionals and consumers.” Education and awareness is something of a bottleneck for Proclaim: “The biggest challenge we are facing as we begin unveiling Proclaim to the world is educating and anchoring Proclaim as a personalized solution that will not only give you your healthiest gums, cleanest teeth and freshest breath,” said Calves, “but also protect your overall health.” LightForce Orthodontics wolfs down $50M to straighten out that crooked smile of yours Helping Proclaim to overcome these challenges are its lead investors Khosla Ventures and Global Asset Capital, as well as those with oral health expertise, Ensemble Innovation Ventures, SpringRock Ventures and Revere Capital. There were also some individual investors in the oversubscribed round: Executive Board Chair Woody Scal, who is the former chief business officer of Fitbit, and Frederic Moll, founder of robotic surgery pioneers Intuitive Surgical and Auris Health. In the long term, Proclaim is aiming to help people achieve healthier gums and cleaner teeth as well as help prevent a number of systemic diseases throughout the body. “Our ultimate goal,” said Calves, “is to establish a new category and platform in at-home oral health care and preventative overall health that effectively addresses these consumer needs in a straightforward logical manner.”"
2024-05-03,How Y Combinator’s founder-matching service helped medical records AI startup Hona land $3M,Startups,"Y Combinator is renowned in Silicon Valley for a lot of reasons, but there’s one service that has quietly become one of its most powerful: an online founder-matching tool. “I think this is the most valuable digital product that YC has built (i.e. more valuable than Bookface, etc.). It’s astonishing how many founders I meet who met each other on the YC co-founder matching platform,” tweeted seed investor Nikhil Basu Trivedi. (Bookface refers to YC’s famed online collection of how-to startup advice for its program participants.) Recent Y Combinator grad Hona is an example, although its founders’ meet-cute story is a bit more exciting than just using that tool. Hona is a GenAI medical records startup. It integrates into multiple electronic records systems and then summarizes a patient’s medical records, helping doctors prep for the patient’s visit. It was initially founded by two friends who have known each other since middle school, Danielle Yoesep and Adam Steinle. They reconnected after graduating college and respective early careers in tech and biotech. Steinle had been a biomedical engineer, Goldman banker and big tech product manager at Facebook. Yoesep was a scientist for a biotech startup that had just been acquired. They were hanging out with their high school friends while home for Thanksgiving, chatting about wanting to do a startup when the idea for Hona arose. While neither of them are doctors themselves, both had family members who are doctors or in healthcare and they soon settled on an idea: AI to assist doctors with patient data summaries. They knew they needed an AI specialist co-founder, so signed up on the Y Combinator Co‑Founder Matching Platform. They found one in Shuying Zhang, who also knew she wanted to do a startup, something in healthcare and AI, and had signed up on the service. Zhang’s background combined biomedical engineering and software development, most recently working on AI at Google, and she was at Amazon prior to that. What came next was a process that sounds a bit like Tinder for co-founders. Yoesep and Steinle swiped through profiles in the matching tool as did Zhang. Each of them held several meet-and-greets with potential co-founders. When Zhang met with Yoesep and Steinle, they instantly clicked so well that the long-time friends offered Zhang a full one-third share of the company. “We literally met each other and like three weeks later, we’re jobless, trying to build this,” Steinle told TechCrunch. Having met on Y Combinator, with their backgrounds in tech, they were exactly the type of startup sure to be accepted into the competitive program. They immediately applied to YC for the Summer 2023 batch. And they were promptly rejected. So they got to work on their own, building a prototype, showing it to their network of doctors, earning solid reviews and raising a small seed round. About four months later, they applied to YC again for the winter 2024 batch, and were accepted. One of the reasons they got in the second time, Yoesep recalled, was that they never changed directions, or never pivoted, to use the hackneyed Silicon Valley term. Another reason was “because of our dynamic during our interview, showing that we had grown close and enjoyed working together,” she said. Things started cooking for them after that. Medical doctors at Duke and Harvard agreed to test the product and write a white paper, due to publish later this month. Some angels who were known in the tech and biotech worlds invested. And by the time Hona graduated from YC and did its famed Demo Day, it had already raised a $3 million seed round from General Catalyst (which is pursuing health tech so seriously it bought a hospital system), Samsung, Rebel Fund (founded by Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman and Cruise co-founder Daniel Kan), Allegis Capital and 1984 Ventures. Hona still has a tough road ahead. AI for medical transcription is an increasingly crowded field. Big cloud providers like Google and Amazon are offering such tools and dozens of startups are tackling it, too. But Steinle says that Hona will compete because it’s “super customizable” to search through medical records for the specific data a particular doctor needs prior to seeing a patient. A cardiologist would get a different summary than a nephrologist. For instance, the upcoming white paper is on kidney stone referrals, so “so we’re pulling stuff like how many millimeters was the stone on the right here?” Steinle describes. As for Zhang, her advice for others who dream of doing a startup, and are considering using YC’s matching tool, is to “just go out and try,” she says. “Once you start working with people, you will quickly have a good sense whether you get along. You will know right away.”"
2023-07-21,Suspending access to medication abortions will threaten telehealth access,Biotech & Health,"Dana Northcraft Contributor Dana Northcraft, the founding director of Reproductive Health Initiative for Telehealth Equity & Solutions (RHITES), is a digital health legal and policy specialist with more than 20 years of experience in law, advocacy, and coalition building. Telehealth has revolutionized the way healthcare services are delivered, becoming an increasingly popular means of providing remote medical care to patients. This was particularly true throughout the COVID-19 pandemic when telehealth was a crucial part of combating a public health crisis. We are now facing another public health crisis: the ongoing erosion of access to abortion in a post-Roe world and the resulting impact to our health systems. While many people don’t know it, telehealth can once again be part of the solution. However, frivolous lawsuits led by extremists, including the recent federal court decision out of Texas ordering the national ban of mifepristone (the first of two medications used in the FDA-approved regimen for medication abortion care), threaten this very safe and effective abortion method. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, expanding telehealth access to abortion is essential to helping people get the care they need. As someone who has worked extensively on solutions for expanding reproductive health access, I know that telehealth is perfectly suited for abortion care. Not only has it been shown to be just as safe and effective as in-person care, it also reduces waiting times, increases privacy, and can reach patients in remote and rural areas — things that have always been needed for abortion provision and are even more important today. Recent data from #WeCount show that telehealth has played an increasingly crucial role in meeting the needs of those seeking abortions since Roe was struck down. Telehealth abortion provided by virtual-only clinics increased by 137% in the six months following the Dobbs decision. If you consider the providers who work in brick-and-mortar clinics who also offer telehealth services, the numbers become even more impactful. It is important to note that while telehealth has increasingly become a linchpin in the ability to access abortion, there are still tens of thousands of people being denied abortion care. Right now, abortion is banned or severely restricted in nearly half the states, leaving large portions of the country without an abortion provider who can even give an in-person consultation. Abortion is a time-sensitive procedure. This is especially true for medication abortion care, which is safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy up to the first 10 to 12 weeks. Finding the means to travel across the state, let alone across state lines, can lead to delays and push this care out of reach, especially for BIPOC populations or those struggling to make ends meet. Like with other healthcare, video conferencing or phone consultations have the potential to obliterate these barriers, enabling providers to screen and counsel patients, remotely prescribe medication, and have it delivered to the patient’s home. Telehealth has expanded the ability of healthcare to reach more and more people. The privacy it affords patients can also reduce the stigma and shame people feel when accessing healthcare. While this is especially important for those who live in areas where they may be concerned about facing judgment, receiving confidential medical attention in a private space of our choosing is something that everyone can benefit from. But when we say “everyone,” we must truly mean everyone. Those who have been and will continue to be most impacted by restrictions on abortion care are the same as those who encounter racism, poverty, and the myriad social determinants of health that negatively impact the lives of people of color and those struggling to make ends meet. We have an opportunity to center equity in healthcare solutions. Bans on medications like mifepristone will exacerbate inequities. When we talk about telehealth delivery of care, we must ensure it reaches communities that lack broadband and smartphone access and provide resources that address language needs and different levels of health literacy. We must center racial justice and provide culturally competent care. The time is now to continue the expansion and availability of telehealth, including for abortion care, not to go backward. There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a crisis, but there is also no doubt that we can meet that crisis with innovative solutions. By bringing advocates, providers, businesses, and innovators together, we can forge partnerships to expand healthcare, including the abortion care ecosystem."
2022-02-07,Koneksa’s $45 million round could help make at-home clinical trials a reality,Biotech & Health,"Rating symptoms on a numerical scale seems easy, but it can be harder than it appears. How much did it hurt when you stubbed your toe? Was it a two out of 10? A four? How often do you wake up at night? Twice, three times? Regularly? Rarely? These imprecise, self-reported scales can be found throughout medicine, even relating to diseases where the stakes are higher than a bruised toenail. Koneksa, founded in 2013, is working toward discovering and validating clinical biomarkers. That process begins by looking to turn those analog scales digital — and improve them in the process. Koneksa has developed a software suite that works with a variety of devices, from portable spirometers to iPhones and Apple Watches. These devices capture data, from which software gleans clinically useful signals and organizes them for review by drug companies or healthcare providers running clinical trials. On the back of several studies, and work with clinical trials at over 700 sites, Koneksa is announcing a Series C raise of $45 million. The company has been comparatively frugal so far, raising $4 million in Series A and seed funding, and a $16 million Series B. This round will be part of a big push to usher in what CMO John Wagner calls an “inflection point” in the digital biomarker world. (Wagner comes to Koneksa after stints at Cynga, Merck, Takeda and Foresite Capital. He also edited the journal Clinical and Translational Science.) “It’s well known that the more measurements you take, the more accuracy you get, and the more power a clinical trial can have. That makes [the trial] smaller, faster and more efficient,” Wagner told TechCrunch. “I like to think of it as the difference between a still photo and a video. A still photo is great, but a video is able to tell the whole story. That’s how we think of digital biomarkers: they tell the whole story compared to traditional biomarkers.” Koneksa’s tremor assessment tool for Parkinson’s. Image Credits: KoneksaImage Credits: Koneksa How does Koneksa go about turning analog scales into digital ones? Parkinson’s offers a clear example. A common, but imperfect, index used to evaluate Parkinson’s patients is called the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale — it’s a multi-part exam that combines questionnaires about mood, daily life and symptoms, with clinical evaluation, like movement tests. To quantify a tremor, a physician might ask a patient to stretch out an arm, and flip their palm upwards and downwards as fast as they can. Meanwhile, the clinician watches for subtle changes in speed or shape of that movement. Koneksa’s approach, instead, has that patient hold their phone, and perform the same motion. The phone’s accelerometer and gyroscope record those changes and transmit data to the company’s platform. Behind the scenes, the company’s algorithms “score” that tremor, similar to how a physician might assign a score after an exam. “The potential of these sensors to give is a far more granular and, I use this word carefully, a more objective, reading of a man’s tremor — there’s tremendous potential in what our technology can do,” CEO Chris Benko told TechCrunch. The idea of revamping analog patient monitoring techniques with tech has already attracted lots of companies. Koneksa is certainly playing in that world, but it doesn’t have its sights set on just software. It’s going after proving the whole thesis of digital biomarker reliability — if not supremacy. It’s great if a phone can pick up tiny hand movements that a doctor might miss. But do those hand movements actually represent tremors? And, do these digitized tests actually tell doctors anything about how patients will fare later on? To know the answers to those questions, digital biomarkers need to be clinically validated. Without that validation, such tools are ultimately useless in clinical trials. “We wanted to focus on gatekeeping problems that are important for getting new therapies to market for patients, and then figure out how to do the scientific validation that shows these technology tools are better or equivalent to what’s out there. We have to do that to the standard of the world’s leading drug companies,” Benko said. That validation is Koneksa’s current focus. In that regard, the company has been able to show that at-home measures do correlate with tests done in a clinic. One study on 12 asthma patients, for example, showed that readouts from an at-home spirometer were comparable to those done in a clinic. The patients did make some mistakes, noted Benko, but because they were able to perform the test more often, the investigators ended up with far more data to work with. A typical asthma clinical trial, the study notes, would need to enroll about 100 patients to get a meaningful result. Using the at-home tests, the authors suggest they could get the same results with just 18 people. “That’s what’s economically interesting to the drug company,” said Benko. “But for the patients, they’re simply saying, it’s more convenient, and it’s more real world.” The company has also been able to make a compelling case that in-home patient data may yield clinically meaningful insight. For instance, the company has run one study on 66 patients with head and neck cancer, where they used wearable devices to measure daily step counts. For every 1,000 steps walked, the study found a 26% reduction in hospitalization risk faced by the patients. However, as Benko noted, it was their activity on the weekends (i.e. movement that patients chose themselves) that revealed this statistic, not the movement schedules they adhered to because of weekday responsibilities. That study was presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, but was not published in a journal. Still, the ultimate decider of clinical validity, at least when it comes to developing drugs, is the FDA. The next step for Koneksa will be to prove these biomarkers are reliable enough to integrate them into the regulatory decision making process. “What we’re teeing up right now are Koneksa-owned or Koneksa-collaboration studies with academics in order to push the envelope on clinical validation,” said Wagner. Koneksa’s complete range of measures. Image Credits: KoneksaImage Credits: Koneksa As for the Series C milestones, Koneksa has two goals. The first is to add to the evidence that backs up their digital biomarker pipeline. In the past, the company has worked alongside their pharma partners to seek out digital biomarkers and validate them. Getting the validation done ahead of these partnerships will allow Koneksa to get new programs off the ground far faster. The second piece is a launch of what Benko calls a “self-service” platform. This self-service platform allows new partners to combine data from multiple devices and wearables into the same place, and organize them into a dashboard. “We recognize that the software’s ability to integrate that [disparate] device data in a clinical trial setting is unique. There isn’t another asset like it on the market. And so why should we control it for every possible use? We want to be able to open it up to say: ‘hey, we can license this platform to you.’” Though these two goals are operationally distinct, they do have a similar flavor. Koneksa is looking to turn their digital biomarkers and platform into a turnkey solution. This round was led by AyurMaya, a fund managed by Matrix Capital Management, with participation from Takeda Ventures and Velosity Capital. Existing investors McKesson Ventures, Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, Novartis (dRx Capital), Spring Mountain Capital and Waterline Ventures also participated in the round."
2023-07-31,Nigeria’s Remedial Health gets QED backing in $12M round,Startups,"Remedial Health, a Nigerian startup digitizing pharmacies and bringing efficiency to the pharmaceutical value chain, has raised $12 million Series A equity-debt funding to scale operations in the West African country. Fintech VC firm QED Investors co-led the round, banking on embedded financial opportunities like payments and lending in the pharmaceutical sector. This is QED’s third investment in Africa after its involvement in the Moniepoint (formerly TeamApt) and FlapKap deals last year. Ventures Platform also co-led the round, which saw the participation of existing investors like Y Combinator, Tencent and Gaingels. Pharmacies and hospitals use Remedial Health’s platform to order pharmaceutical products sourced from reliable and trusted manufacturers and verified distributors. This helps to stem erratic prices and the supply of fake and substandard products that are behind thousands of preventable deaths in Nigeria and Africa at large. It also ensures proper handling of the products, which can’t be said of the open drugs market in Nigeria. QED closes on $925M to back fintech startups globally A recent report by Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control estimates that about 15% of the medicine sold in the country is fake or substandard. And it is estimated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that half a million people die in sub-Saharan Africa owing to substandard or counterfeit medicine. Remedial Health gets $4 million debt funding to scale inventory financing Founded by Samuel Okwuada (CEO) and Victor Benjamin (COO) in 2021, Remedial Health plans to use the new funding to deepen its operations in Nigeria. The funding includes $4 million debt to help it scale inventory financing. Okwuada told TechCrunch that the priority at the moment remains on increasing penetration in 34 states by getting more pharmacies and hospitals signed up, especially in rural areas, where demand is growing. “We are seeing more growth in rural areas, because they are difficult to reach, and are far from major open drug markets in Nigeria,” said Okwuada, adding that the startup currently has a “considerable market share” in at least half of the 34 of 36 states it operates in within Nigeria. The YC alumnus currently serves over 5,000 pharmacies and hospitals, having grown its client count by 3x since November last year. It sources the over 8,000 products it sells from 300 manufacturers, among them GSK, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Its inventory financing, which enables its clients to restock without upfront payment, has helped grow its client count and revenues by 7x over the last 10 months too. “We are a B2B business and we are able to provide inventory to these pharmacies without requesting cash upfront, or at the point of delivery. . . . We’ve seen them grow their businesses, open additional branches because they are able to get credit,” said Okwuada. Remedial’s platform enables its customers to manage their operations including inventory management (through an app too), accounting, and financial reporting. It also provides real-time market intelligence that informs manufacturers on production and distribution. Okwuada said its customers receive orders within 24 hours. The startup has a network of distribution hubs, spread across the regions it serves, and does last-mile delivery in-house or through partners. Other startups bringing efficiency in the pharmaceutical value chain include MyDawa, and DrugStoc. Commenting on the investment, QED Investors partner and head of Africa Gbenga Ajayi said in a statement: “The success that Remedial Health has enjoyed to date is an indication of the market gap that exists, and their value in providing effective holistic services to thousands of pharmacies across Nigeria.” “QED is particularly excited about the embedded financial services opportunities within the vertical — the ability to provide payments, embedded lending and other fintech solutions to this underserved but very crucial sector.” Nigeria’s YC-backed Remedial Health raises $4.4M seed funding Kenya’s MyDawa aims to be an all-in-one health platform backed by $20 million funding"
2020-05-21,"With an ex-Uber exec as its new CEO, digital mental health service Mindstrong raises $100 million",Biotech & Health,"Daniel Graf has had a long career in the tech industry. From founding his own startup in the mid-2000s to working at Google, then Twitter, and finally Uber, the tech business has made him extremely wealthy. But after leaving Uber, he wasn’t necessarily interested in working at another business… at least, not until he spent an afternoon in the spring of 2019 with an old friend, General Catalyst managing director Hemant Taneja, walking in San Francisco’s South Park neighborhood and hearing Taneja talk about a new startup called Mindstrong Health. Taneja told Graf that by the fall of that year, he’d be working at Mindstrong… and Taneja was right. “I was intrigued by healthtech previously,” said Graf. “The problem always was… and it sounds a little too money-oriented… but if there’s no clear visibility around who pays who in a startup, the startup isn’t going to work,” and that was always his issue with healthcare businesses. NEW YORK, NY – MAY 21: Daniel Graf accepts a Webby award for Google Maps for iPhone at the 17th Annual Webby Awards at Cipriani Wall Street on May 21, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for The Webby Awards)Image Credits: Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Files With Mindstrong, which announced today that it has raised $100 million in new financing, the issue of who pays is clear. So Graf joined the company in November as chief executive, taking over from Paul Dagum, who remains with Mindstrong as its chief scientific officer. “Daniel joined the company as it was moving from pure R&D into being something commercially available,” said Taneja, in an email. “In healthcare, it’s increasingly important to understand how to build for the consumer and that’s where Daniel’s experience and background comes in. Paul remains a core part of the team because none of this happens without the science.” The company, which has developed a digital platform for providing therapy to patients with severe mental illnesses ranging from schizophrenia to obsessive compulsive disorders, is looking to tackle a problem that costs the American healthcare system $20 billion per month, Graf said. Unlike companies like Headspace and Calm, which have focused on the mental wellness market for the mass consumer, Mindstrong is focused on people with severe mental health conditions, said Graf. That means people who are either bipolar, schizophrenic or have major depressive disorder. It’s a much larger population than most Americans think, and they face a critical problem in their ability to receive adequate care, Graf said. “1 in 5 adults experience mental illness, 1 in 25 experience serious mental illness, and the pandemic is making these numbers worse. Meanwhile, more than 60% of US counties don’t have a single practicing psychiatrist,” said Joe Lonsdale, the founder of 8VC, and an investor in the latest Mindstrong Health round, in a statement. Dagum, Mindstrong Health’s founder, has been working on the issue of how to provide better access and monitoring for indications of potential episodes of distress since 2013. The company’s technology provides a range of monitoring and measurement tools using digital biomarkers that are currently being validated through clinical trials, according to Graf. “We’re passively measuring the usage of the phone and the timing of the keyboard strokes to measure how [a patient] is doing,” Graf said. These smartphone interactions can provide data around mental acuity and emotional valence, according to Graf — and can provide signs that someone might be having problems. The company also provides access to therapists via phone and video consultations or text-based asynchronous communications, based on user preference. “Think of us more as a virtual hospital… our care pathways are super complex for this population,” said Graf. “We’re not aware of other startups working with this population. These folks, the best you get right now is the county mental health.” Mindstrong’s Series C raise included participation from new and existing investors, including General Catalyst, ARCH Ventures, Optum Ventures, Foresite Capital, 8VC, What If Ventures and Bezos Expeditions, along with other, undisclosed investors. And while mental health is the company’s current focus, the platform for care delivery that the company is building has broader implications for the industry, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, according to Taneja. “I expect that we’ll see discoveries in biomarker tech like Mindstrong’s that could be applied horizontally across almost any area of healthcare,” Taneja said in an email. “Because healthcare is so broad and varied, going vertical like Mindstrong is makes a lot of sense. There’s opportunity to become a successful and very impactful company by staying narrowly focused and solving some really hard problems for even a smaller part of the overall population.”"
2022-10-21,Sight Tech Global 2022 announced,Biotech & Health,"As we prepare for the third annual Sight Tech Global (December 7-8, free & virtual, register here), a technology event that tracks the advances in technology supporting people who live with blindness, two big shifts are front and center. First, new digital experiences, notably virtual reality, are testing known approaches to accessibility. There are no white canes or screen readers (yet!) in the metaverse. That digital realm is on the verge of going mainstream both for consumers and enterprises so quickly that accessibility could easily become an afterthought, as it was at the start of the PV era. At Sight Tech Global, we will hear from the people working to ensure that the metaverse is open to all. The event is free and virtual! Second, the technology platforms underpinning so many of the breakthroughs in assistive and access tech — the tools that help blind and low vision people navigate the world — are advancing fast and enabling better, cheaper devices. Not long ago, AI-powered computer vision systems were costly marvels of miniaturized cameras, GPUs and batteries, but faster networks, cloud services and more powerful mobile phones are changing everything, especially the cost. The old debate in access tech was which would prevail — universal technology platforms such as mobile phones with built-in accessibility features, or purpose-built devices specifically for people who need vision assistance. The emerging formula is not one or the other but both, in a winning combination. At Sight Tech Global, we will hear from the technologists applying the new approaches to next generation devices. Register today. And underlying so much of these discussions is the evolution of AI itself, which is a critical technology across the spectrum of blind tech. The current “deep learning” form of AI continues to deliver striking results in forms such as the natural language GPT3 or many computer vision AIs. But there is growing dissatisfaction with the ability of those powerful pattern-recognition systems to apply something more like human reasoning to issues large and small, not to mention filter out the bias and problems when AIs are unleashed. At Sight Tech Global, we will hear from top AI technologists grappling with those topics and more. The event agenda will be ready in a month, but we hope you will register today. The event is free and virtual. And one new twist in 2022: Sight Tech Global is adding an “In Person” event on December 9 in San Jose, California. The event is aimed at technologists, product leaders and designers working in access tech. The event is limited to 150 people and by invitation only. Most of the programming will be workshops driven by attendees. Here’s where you can request an invitation or nominate someone. Sight Tech Global is a production of the nonprofit Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired. We’re grateful to current sponsors APH, Amazon, Google, Fable, Humanware, LinkedIn, Microsoft and Waymo. If you would like to sponsor the event, please contact us. All sponsorship revenues go to the nonprofit Vista Center, which has been serving the Silicon Valley area for 75 years."
2023-04-11,Elizabeth Holmes is denied request to stay out of prison,Biotech & Health,"Former Theranos CEO and convicted fraud Elizabeth Holmes is expected to go to prison on April 27 for a sentence of more than 11 years. After Holmes was found guilty on four fraud counts last year, her lawyers have made numerous attempts to delay her incarceration, like petitioning for a new trial. Now Judge Edward Davila, who presided over her high-profile case, has denied her request to stay out of prison on bail. Davila wrote that Holmes is not a flight risk or a threat to her community, however, the court has not found substantial reason to keep her out of prison. Holmes is expected to appeal this ruling to the 9th Circuit Court, but it’s unlikely her appeal will succeed. The 9th Circuit rejected a similar appeal from former Theranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was found guilty on 12 counts of fraud. Once a hot-shot Silicon Valley startup worth more than $9 billion, Theranos vowed to revolutionize the medical field by making blood testing more accessible. In a now-infamous pitch, Theranos claimed that with just one drop of blood, it could conduct dozens of blood tests, rendering intravenous blood draws moot. But despite Theranos’ massive valuation and high-profile board members, its technology never worked. Now, its disgraced chief officers are preparing for prison. What’s left to learn from Theranos? Have friends."
2023-12-14,Qogita — a wholesale marketplace for retailers — raises $86M Series B to compete with Ankorstore in Europe,Biotech & Health,"Qogita, a two-sided e-commerce wholesale marketplace aimed at retailers largely in the health and beauty sectors, has raised €80 million ($86 million) in a Series B round led by London’s Dawn Capital. The company plans to use the cash to expand into more categories. Also participating were previous investors Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners and LocalGlobe. Qogita has now raised a total of €119 million. Targeting SME e-commerce retailers and businesses that want to deal with a more “all-in-one” wholesale platform, Qogita is not dissimilar to Faire.com in the U.S. (which has raised $1.7 billion to date) and Ankorstore out of France (which has raised €365 million) — or indeed Alibaba, which in many ways defined the market for B2B wholesale commerce online. Qogita was co-founded by London-based Yaniv Toledano, formerly of Goldman Sachs, and Danny Toledano, a former president of Isramco, the oil and gas exploration company operating in the U.S. and Israel. As the names imply, the founders are father and son. CEO Manolis Manassakis, a former director of EMEA operations at Uber, joined as COO in 2021 but was appointed CEO this year. A request to interview either Toledano was declined. In response to why Qogita hired an outside CEO to lead it, a spokesperson for the company said in an email: “It takes a different skill set to build a company from the ground up and scale it. With the fundraising and ambitious goals, the consensus was that someone with experience in scaling marketplaces would be the best fit to take the company forward.” The company kicked off in 2021 with an Amazon-like buying process for this time-stretched sector: It handles the process end to end, including shipping and delivery. It also has a BNPL platform for SMEs with cash flow issues. Over a call, Manassakis told me: “We’re a market where you can think of us as a two-sided marketplace with the buyers or retailers or the sellers or wholesalers, distributors and brands.” Manassakis admits that B2B marketplaces have had “such a tough time” — the market is crowded, and arguably it makes for very little differentiation among retailers if they are all selling the same things, so both of these will impact margin. But he also believes that there remain opportunities here for those refining the model. “The incentive to go off platform is very high. In our case, we pair one buyer to multiple sellers. The same order breaks down into pieces, based on the stock of that in that moment, the price in that moment, available quantities, minimum quantities, fulfilment rate, quality… 10 different variables,” he said. “So it’s impossible for the buyer to replicate the value we have, because the answer to what is the best possible cart changes every five minutes, and that’s what we’re doing.” He said the founders started an e-commerce business on Amazon and realized that “by far the biggest problem they had was to procure the goods from their sellers, versus anything else. So then we switched to this current business. That’s how the discovery came about.” He says there is no “direct competitor” but Faire, Ankorstore and Alibaba come closest. Ankerstore was contacted for comment but had not replied by the time of publication. We have also reached out to the investors for more direct comments for this story. In a statement, Norman Fiore, general partner at Dawn Capital, said: “It is remarkable how complex and completely opaque product procurement still is for small and medium-sized businesses targeting the $6 trillion e-commerce market. Qogita has built an all-in-one platform to address the entire wholesale procurement process.” Luca Bocchio, partner at Accel, also added: “The B2B wholesale market in Europe is huge, but also fragmented and complex. Currently, trade is done in an inefficient, undigitized way, and Qogita has the opportunity to become the digital enabler of the whole value chain, bringing more efficiency and transparency to a notoriously grey market.” Qogita team. Image Credits: Qogita The market to provide these one-click services to SME retailers is heating up as the wider sector digitizes. The global health and beauty market is predicted to be worth $785 billion by 2025. And in April, Ankorstore launched a new membership program for independent retailers in Europe, removing minimum checkout amounts and waiving heavy/fragile shipping fees, plus a 90-day BNPL offer. Last year it raised a $283 million Series C funding round led by Bond and Tiger Global, but it has not escaped the need to cut jobs in this tougher market for raising capital."
2022-09-14,"Perceptron: AI that lights up the moon, improvises grammar and teaches robots to walk like humans",AI,"Research in the field of machine learning and AI, now a key technology in practically every industry and company, is far too voluminous for anyone to read it all. This column, Perceptron, aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter. Over the past few weeks, scientists developed an algorithm to uncover fascinating details about the moon’s dimly lit — and in some cases pitch-black — asteroid craters. Elsewhere, MIT researchers trained an AI model on textbooks to see whether it could independently figure out the rules of a specific language. And teams at DeepMind and Microsoft investigated whether motion capture data could be used to teach robots how to perform specific tasks, like walking. With the pending (and predictably delayed) launch of Artemis I, lunar science is again in the spotlight. Ironically, however, it is the darkest regions of the moon that are potentially the most interesting, since they may house water ice that can be used for countless purposes. It’s easy to spot the darkness, but what’s in there? An international team of image experts has applied ML to the problem with some success. Though the craters lie in deepest darkness, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter still captures the occasional photon from within, and the team put together years of these underexposed (but not totally black) exposures with a “physics-based, deep learning-driven post-processing tool” described in Geophysical Research Letters. The result is that “visible routes into the permanently shadowed regions can now be designed, greatly reducing risks to Artemis astronauts and robotic explorers,” according to David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary institute. Let there be light! The interior of the crater is reconstructed from stray photons. Image Credits: V. T. Bickel, B. Moseley, E. Hauber, M. Shirley, J.-P. Williams and D. A. Kring They’ll have flashlights, we imagine, but it’s good to have a general idea of where to go beforehand, and of course it could affect where robotic exploration or landers focus their efforts. However useful, there’s nothing mysterious about turning sparse data into an image. But in the world of linguistics, AI is making fascinating inroads into how and whether language models really know what they know. In the case of learning a language’s grammar, an MIT experiment found that a model trained on multiple textbooks was able to build its own model of how a given language worked, to the point where its grammar for Polish, say, could successfully answer textbook problems about it. “Linguists have thought that in order to really understand the rules of a human language, to empathize with what it is that makes the system tick, you have to be human. We wanted to see if we can emulate the kinds of knowledge and reasoning that humans (linguists) bring to the task,” said MIT’s Adam Albright in a news release. It’s very early research on this front but promising in that it shows that subtle or hidden rules can be “understood” by AI models without explicit instruction in them. But the experiment didn’t directly address a key, open question in AI research: how to prevent language models from outputting toxic, discriminatory or misleading language. New work out of DeepMind does tackle this, taking a philosophical approach to the problem of aligning language models with human values. Researchers at the lab posit that there’s no “one-size-fits-all” path to better language models, because the models need to embody different traits depending on the contexts in which they’re deployed. For example, a model designed to assist in scientific study would ideally only make true statements, while an agent playing the role of a moderator in a public debate would exercise values like toleration, civility and respect. So how can these values be instilled in a language model? The DeepMind co-authors don’t suggest one specific way. Instead, they imply models can cultivate more “robust” and “respectful” conversations over time via processes they call context construction and elucidation. As the co-authors explain: “Even when a person is not aware of the values that govern a given conversational practice, the agent may still help the human understand these values by prefiguring them in conversation, making the course of communication deeper and more fruitful for the human speaker.” Google’s LaMDA language model responding to a question. Image Credits: Google Sussing out the most promising methods to align language models takes immense time and resources — financial and otherwise. But in domains beyond language, particularly scientific domains, that might not be the case for much longer, thanks to a $3.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded to a team of scientists from the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory and MIT. With the NSF grant, the recipients plan to build what they describe as “model gardens,” or repositories of AI models designed to solve problems in areas like physics, mathematics and chemistry. The repositories will link the models with data and computing resources as well as automated tests and screens to validate their accuracy, ideally making it simpler for scientific researchers to test and deploy the tools in their own studies. “A user can come to the [model] garden and see all that information at a glance,” Ben Blaiszik, a data science researcher at Globus Labs involved with the project, said in a press release. “They can cite the model, they can learn about the model, they can contact the authors, and they can invoke the model themselves in a web environment on leadership computing facilities or on their own computer.” Meanwhile, over in the robotics domain, researchers are building a platform for AI models not with software, but with hardware — neuromorphic hardware to be exact. Intel claims the latest generation of its experimental Loihi chip can enable an object recognition model to “learn” to identify an object it’s never seen before using up to 175 times less power than if the model were running on a CPU. A humanoid robot equipped with one of Intel’s experimental neuromorphic chips. Image Credits: Intel Neuromorphic systems attempt to mimic the biological structures in the nervous system. While traditional machine learning systems are either fast or power efficient, neuromorphic systems achieve both speed and efficiency by using nodes to process information and connections between the nodes to transfer electrical signals using analog circuitry. The systems can modulate the amount of power flowing between the nodes, allowing each node to perform processing — but only when required. Intel and others believe that neuromorphic computing has applications in logistics, for example powering a robot built to help with manufacturing processes. It’s theoretical at this point — neuromorphic computing has its downsides — but perhaps one day, that vision will come to pass. Image Credits: DeepMind Closer to reality is DeepMind’s recent work in “embodied intelligence,” or using human and animal motions to teach robots to dribble a ball, carry boxes and even play football. Researchers at the lab devised a setup to record data from motion trackers worn by humans and animals, from which an AI system learned to infer how to complete new actions, like how to walk in a circular motion. The researchers claim that this approach translated well to real-world robots, for example allowing a four-legged robot to walk like a dog while simultaneously dribbling a ball. Coincidentally, Microsoft earlier this summer released a library of motion capture data intended to spur research into robots that can walk like humans. Called MoCapAct, the library contains motion capture clips that, when used with other data, can be used to create agile bipedal robots — at least in simulation. “[Creating this dataset] has taken the equivalent of 50 years over many GPU-equipped [servers] … a testament to the computational hurdle MoCapAct removes for other researchers,” the co-authors of the work wrote in a blog post. “We hope the community can build off of our dataset and work to do incredible research in the control of humanoid robots.” Peer review of scientific papers is invaluable human work, and it’s unlikely AI will take over there, but it may actually help make sure that peer reviews are actually helpful. A Swiss research group has been looking at model-based evaluation of peer reviews, and their early results are mixed — in a good way. There wasn’t some obvious good or bad method or trend, and publication impact rating didn’t seem to predict whether a review was thorough or helpful. That’s okay though, because although quality of reviews differs, you wouldn’t want there to be a systematic lack of good review everywhere but major journals, for instance. Their work is ongoing. Last, for anyone concerned about creativity in this domain, here’s a personal project by Karen X.

2023-08-18,"Viome, a microbiome startup, raises $86.5M, inks distribution deal with CVS",AI,"Research on the human microbiome — microorganism communities that live in a part of your body such as your mouth or gut — has led to a number of insights and spurred further investigations into what makes up a healthy person. Combined with the continuing interest in alternative medicine, that is leading to some venture dollars getting channeled into at least one prominent startup in the space. Viome — which has built a business out of assessing customers’ microbiomes, applying AI to the data and using that to provide them with supplements and other guidance based on the findings — has raised $86.5 million to expand its business. The funding, a Series C, is being co-led by Khosla Ventures and Bold Capital, with other unnamed current and new investors also participating. The company claims that its RNA sequencing technology, which was originally developed out of research from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, “is clinically validated, fully automated, exclusively licensed by Viome [to analyze] biological samples at least 1,000 times greater than other technologies.” The company, based out of Bellevue, Washington, and founded in 2016, says that it has run tests for some 350,000 consumers from 106 countries (primarily the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia) to date, working out to some 600,000 samples that are feeding and informing its algorithm. Its plan is to use the equity funding both to expand existing business — which includes tests based on samples of a person’s blood, stools and saliva, vitamin supplements and assessments around diet — as well as to break into new areas. That will include new product lines around mouth and dental health, and retail partnerships, including a deal with CVS that will see the pharmacy chain offer Viome tests in some 200 stores in the U.S. The CVS deal — in which CVS is buying kits in a wider revenue share agreement — will not include CVS investing in Viome, CEO and founder Naveen Jain (the entrepreneur who founded Infospace in the first wave of dot-com startups, helped judge the XPrize and more) said in an interview. “They believe that more and more people are becoming gut-health conscious and they want to sell the product in their store,” to address that, he added, downing some of what he told me were his own custom-designed capsules (a mix of pre- and probiotics and vitamins) while talking to me. Viome is not disclosing its valuation, but to date it has raised $175 million and was last valued in 2022 (when it disclosed a new $67 million in funding) at $339 million, according to PitchBook data. That valuation “has not gone down,” Jain said, but he would not give an updated number. Investors in the company have included Marc Benioff, a healthcare investor called Better Health Group and SquareOne Capital, among others. Viome’s raise and plans to grow come amid a critical moment for companies like it, playing in the crossover of healthcare, technology, biotech and changing consumer sentiments. In countries like the U.S., as standard medical services continue to get more expensive covering an ever-wider set of conditions, we’re seeing a growing population of consumers swing toward what they see as complementary, or even replacements, for pursuing the former route. (The pursuit of alternative remedies is not always innocuous or complementary; it has had its mix of controversial chapters: During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, skepticism or full-out rejection of big medicine led to a wave of people refusing to take vaccines, pushing bogus remedies and a tsunami of fake news related to both of those.) While Viome in some ways seems to sit squarely in the category of alternative medicine with its focus on vitamin supplements tailored to a particular person’s needs, and the idea that you can cure certain ailments by providing these and guidance after analyzing an individual’s particular microbiome and other physical details, in other ways it markets itself as a startup that exists on the back of the advances afforded by advances in technology. There is the fact that its original insights come out of Los Alamos and its focus on RNA gene expression — an approach that it says “enables us to provide individuals with recommendations that can be effective, dynamic and relevant to their current state of health,” but also its use of AI. “Viome has been an AI company from day 1 and is not something we adopted now,” a company spokesperson told me. “Viome’s platform was designed to analyze and interpret massive amounts of biological data using AI and machine learning technologies.” The company claims to have “the world’s largest database of RNA sequencing data from >600,000 samples from our customers and clinical research participants. When combined with rich clinical metadata (medications, symptoms, diagnoses, etc.), Viome has >52 petabytes (quadrillion) of data.” In turn Viome interprets that data, it says, using “modern AI, machine learning and bioinformatics methods running on massive cloud computing…to identify what is important for human health, and translate those findings into personalized nutritional recommendations for each customer.” It claims to have more than 35 predictive models of chronic diseases including diabetes, obesity, depression, IBS and IBD, and says it has FDA breakthrough device designation “for its ability to detect early-stage cancer in the mouth and throat using saliva with 95% specificity and over 90% sensitivity.” But not all is completely smooth sailing in this space. At least one company — uBiome, previously thought of as a peer and competitor to Viome — was investigated and eventually indicted by the government over how it ran its business, covering not only its efforts to defraud insurance companies, but also how it skirted regulations, lied to investors and others, ran and charged for unnecessary tests and overall did not provide what it claimed to provide. There are in fact dozens of other startups building products and services around microbiome research, and one big question mark for scientists in the field is whether microbiome research can so easily be lined up with conclusions and treatments as it has been by companies like Viome. “Every time I have looked at what Viome is claiming to do, it has unquestionably made statements that are completely misleading and not representative of the science in the field or [even] of the science that they have shown themselves,” Dr. Jonathan Eisen, a professor at University of California, Davis, and a specialist in medical microbiology and genomics, said in an interview. Eisen once called the company the “Theranos of Microbiome Studies” and dug in deeper over time — before, he tells me, he was sidetracked by a certain pandemic. “I have been not doing a lot of ‘Overselling the microbiome’ related posts recently largely because I was doing double duty working on COVID,” he told me separately over email. “But I am starting to get back into microbiome communications issues and I can say that the #1 most egregiously misleading group / company / entity I have seen recently is Viome. I am bombarded with their ads and all seem to be misleading, scientifically inaccurate, and bad.” When I mentioned Eisen to Jain, Jain’s response was to tell me that the professor worked for a competitor, a claim Eisen dismissed, saying he was never paid to make any comment, and that although he once did sit on the Scientific Advisory Board of uBiome he said he resigned around 2016 because he “did not like what they were doing in this space from a marketing point of view” (with the company later facing more issues that got them into much bigger trouble with the Feds). Eisen noted that although what Viome has built for diagnostics is notable and useful potentially for the study of microbiomes, that’s not the same as the extensive testing needed around the building of treatments for different conditions. “They still have no evidence that they can take and identify what is wrong or right from microbiome data,” he said."
2022-10-18,"Calm launches clinical mental health offering, Calm Health",Biotech & Health,"Calm, the subscription-based mindfulness app, today announced its first foray into a clinical mental health offering: Calm Health. Offered through payers, providers and self-insured employers, Calm Health includes condition-specific programs designed to “bridge the gap between mental and physical healthcare,” according to the company. Calm Health doesn’t replace Calm’s previous employer offering, Calm for Business, but builds off of Calm’s acquisition of tech startup Ripple Health Group in early February. Using Ripple’s technology, Calm Health connects users with different healthcare options, starting with support for patients suffering from anxiety or depression or using programs in between therapy sessions. Calm plans to eventually add mental health programs for people with physical conditions like hypertension, obesity, heart disease and cancer. “Mental health has risen to the forefront of our nation’s health concerns,” Calm CEO David Ko said in a statement. “From the tolls of the pandemic to financial uncertainty and workplace anxieties, people have turned to Calm over the past ten years to manage their mental health. As we move into healthcare, our goal is to reach even more people with clinical mental health tools and destigmatize the importance of regular mental healthcare.” The rollout of Calm Health comes after a bit of a rough patch for Calm, which laid off 20% of its staff in August as usage fell from a pandemic peak. Prior to the layoffs, Ripple CEO David Ko became Calm’s chief executive, signaling the company’s ambitions to move into new market opportunities. As of December 2020, Calm was valued at $2 billion and had raised $218 million from investors including Insight Venture Partners, Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures and Creative Artists Agency. It competes against rivals including Headspace Health, the result of a 2021 merger between mental health company Ginger and mindfulness-focused Headspace. Headspace Health recently acquired Shine and Sayana as the macroeconomic climate spurred consolidation in the health tech space."
2024-03-12,Tierra Biosciences nabs $11M to create new AI-guided proteins,Biotech & Health,"Scientific breakthroughs have accelerated the pace at which new pharmaceuticals are being developed. Tierra Biosciences thinks that pace can go faster. The San Leandro-based company has developed a platform for AI-guided, custom protein synthesis to help pharmaceutical, industrial and agricultural organizations develop new proteins in weeks rather than months. Simply put, Tierra is enabling customers to order proteins online that can make anything from antibodies to growth factor for a food product. The platform creates cell-free reagents, or a digital sequence to a protein. Tierra makes the DNA, or the codes for the protein. Its reagents are combined with the customer’s protein sequences and put into a robotic platform to create the proteins. “When that protein goes through the process, we start generating lots of data,” Michael Nemzek, Tierra’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “We look at things like stability and solubility, and all these different parameters of the protein, and then we take that in front of a closed feedback loop.” As biological manufacturing moves to the mainstream, Synvitrobio rebrands and raises cash Organizations traditionally develop new proteins using living cells, which Nemzek says is slow, inefficient and relies on poor data. Tierra instead uses cell-free technology, which is able to cut down the timeline from months to weeks and tell a customer if their protein will work or not. For example, if a customer is making an enzyme for a laundry detergent, Tierra plugs it into its AI-powered large language model. That spits out data on if the existing sequence will work or if it needs to be changed. It gives a complete picture of the protein before the customer needs to iterate, saving time and money from a live-cell development process, Nemzek said. “People making proteins today have to order DNA and then they have to transfect living cells. And there’s a lot to do to keep the cells alive,” Nemzek said. “We provide an extremely high throughput way of generating protein. If somebody needs 100 proteins to validate their AI model, we can do that in a few weeks. People can’t do that on their own without spending a lot of money.” Tierra’s AI data model becomes larger with each protein it makes, and the company has made more than 5,000 proteins to date. However, there are an infinite number of proteins that could be made in the world, Nemzek said. We profiled Tierra Biosciences in 2018 after it rebranded from Synvitrobio and raised $2.6 million in new financing. Since then, the company went on to grab $7.2 million in grants from respectable government agencies, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Tierra Biosciences’ protein manufacturing laboratory. Image Credits: Tierra Biosciences It also brought on Nemzek as CEO in 2022. He replaced co-founder Zachary Sun who now serves as chief scientific officer. Prior to joining the company, Nemzek was chief commercial officer at Synthego Corp., where he led the commercial expansion and growth of its CRISPR genome engineering business. Now with $11.4 million of new Series A funding, Nemzek is leading Tierra toward commercialization. The investment was led by Material Impact, a fund co-founded by Adam Sharkawy (a dealmaker at The Medicines Company before Novartis acquired it in 2020) and Carmichael Roberts (known for his investment work at climate fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by a who’s who of billionaires). The round had participation from new and existing investors, including Prosus Ventures, In-Q-Tel (IQT), Hillspire, Freeflow Ventures, Creative Ventures and Social Capital. Tierra already has relationships with some major pharmaceutical, industrial and agricultural organizations. It will use this new funding to expand to a broader set of customers and partners and build out more of its AI data generation capabilities. It will also hire a commercial team to start showing more aggressive sales growth since launching the platform about a year ago. Some customers have also expressed interest in new industry-specific cell-free systems that don’t exist yet, Nemzek said. Tierra is working on that as well as increasing the quantities of proteins it can produce. Currently, it can produce milligrams for customers to experiment with, and in the next month or two will scale to a gram, which is more suitable for pilot programs. “Do we believe cell-free technologies will solve every protein problem? No, but it will solve about 80% of the curve,” Nemzek said. “If you’re trying to design a new protein to do whatever you’re interested in, you can go beyond nature, and use Tierra’s predictive powers to develop the protein functions.” A road map for climate investors"
2022-10-28,54gene valuation slashed by over $100M amid job cuts and CEO exit,Biotech & Health,"It’s been a strange couple of months at African genomics startup 54gene. In August, it sacked 95 employees, mostly contract staff (in labs and sales departments) hired to work in 54gene’s COVID business line launched in 2020. In September, co-founder and VP of Engineering Ogochukwu Francis Osifo left the company. And this week, founder and now ex-CEO Dr. Abasi Ene-Obong stepped down from his executive role to be replaced by General Counsel Teresia L. Bost. This news coincided with more job cuts. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that this second round of layoffs, which took place on Tuesday, affected over 100 staff: 55% of the total workforce remaining after the first round of layoffs. The biotech didn’t specify what roles and departments got trimmed. The Washington- and Lagos-based genomics startup has been considered the showpiece of Africa’s fledging biotech space since it got into Y Combinator in 2019. But while 54gene launched to address the gap in the global genomics market, where Africans make up less than 3% of genetic material used in pharmaceutical research, its growth in 2020 overlapped elsewhere, with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it hired aggressively to meet the demands of being one of Nigeria’s largest providers of COVID testing. Its preparedness to meet this opportunity with its clinical diagnostic arm was also a catalyst to increasing its revenue and raising two huge growth rounds in quick succession: a $15 million Series A that year and a $25 million Series B in 2021 from investors such as New York-based Adjuvant Capital, Pan-African firm Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund (CAIF), KdT Ventures and Endeavor Catalyst. Yet, 2022 will be a year to forget for the biotech startup. Not only has its revenues dwindled and laid off almost 200 employees, but the company’s value has also been significantly trimmed in a period when startups’ valuations are taking a beating. According to people with knowledge of the matter, 54gene’s valuation has dropped by two-thirds, from the $170 million secured when it raised its Series B to about $50 million in a bridge round involving lead investors from the company’s board. Sources also said the down round closed at a 3x to 4x liquidation preference, meaning that investors — typically the lead investor — would be paid back triple or quadruple their money before other stakeholders, including other investors, founders and employees in the case of an exit. These terms, which shift power back to investors, were rare during the venture capital boom between mid-2020 and last year but are now commonplace in this fundraising environment. 54gene didn’t confirm or deny the premise of this deal. Still, it stated in an email response: “The existing investors injected fresh capital into the company at terms that reflect current market conditions. We hope this round not only supports the company through this challenging period but also positions it for success in the future — whether it be to raise additional capital, attract strategic partners, or another future path.” Often, liquidation preferences signal that investors want to protect themselves if a growth-stage portfolio company exits at a value lower than initially expected. In some cases, the investors believe that the startup might struggle to produce a solid exit due to underlying challenges affecting its business. 54gene CEO steps down as the company looks to cut more jobs When the company’s first layoff news broke, allegations of financial impropriety were leveled against the then-CEO and his executives from a group of employees. And though they remain unfounded, these accusations have come to light again following Ene-Obong’s resignation which has since been denied by the CEO. Affected employees — who claim they haven’t received their severance packages and spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity — unsubstantially blame 54gene’s current troubles on irresponsible hiring, questionable expansion drives and misappropriation of funds. The YC-backed biotech didn’t respond to TechCrunch’s request for comments about its former executives’ alleged mismanagement of funds and employees’ unpaid severance packages. 54gene’s tight-lippedness on the matter and Bost’s appointment from her legal role to interim CEO arbitrarily raises questions and leaves room for interpretation tilting toward these accusations, especially as both co-founders resigned a few weeks apart. However, in an email to TechCrunch, the company subtly counterargues that Osifo’s resignation had been in process for some time and was unrelated to this month’s activities, while Bost, hired last September, was what 54gene needed — with support from COO Delali Attipoe — for its next phase. “Teresia is a well-rounded executive with a depth of experience in the global pharmaceutical and biotech industry, leading global teams and overseeing corporate governance,” the company said. “These skills, coupled with her breadth of experience driving business operations and translating complex regulatory requirements, will be invaluable at the helm of 54gene in this next phase of the company. Delali and Teresia will make a great team that together will strengthen 54gene’s position as a genomics leader in the industry.” Meanwhile, 54gene stated that its ex-chief executive “will continue to support the company in its go-forward plans such as strategic partnerships and fundraising” without explaining why he stepped down. African genomics startup 54gene lays off 95 as COVID testing business struggles However, according to several people with knowledge of happenings at the company, the terms of 54gene’s new deal contributed to Ene-Obong’s resignation. They say Ene-Obong — retaining his position on 54gene’s board while moving to a new senior advisor role — may have resigned as CEO in protest of 54gene’s new valuation and the liquidation preference offered by investors in the bridge round. There is some speculation that some of the investors also attempted to reprise the company’s previous prized round to get more shares while diluting that of the founders and other investors. 54gene declined to comment on the matter. The fact that 54gene had to arrange a bridge round in-house despite securing over $45 million over the last three years is a reminder that biotech projects are highly capital-intensive — for instance, it costs about $700 to sequence a human genome (one of 54gene’s main procedures). Typically, biotechs deploy investors’ funds into research while thinking about revenue later and the case isn’t different with 54gene. Still, the manner in which the genome startup is aggressively cutting costs by laying off staff in two batches– and shutting down its clinical diagnostic arm — is somewhat troubling despite the obvious effects of the pandemic. This current crisis, coupled with the arduous task ahead of the company, has also led many tech observers to wonder if its present and past executives can keep the moonshot project afloat long enough to generate substantial revenue, let alone build a solid business.

2024-05-04,Deal Dive: Amae Health is building an in-person approach to mental healthcare in an increasingly digital space,Biotech & Health,"When Sonia García and Stas Sokolin decided to launch Amae Health to solve the broken care system for people with severe mental illness, they were already intimately familiar with the industry’s issues. “I started thinking about this problem a very long time ago,” said Sokolin, Amae’s CEO. “I grew up with a sister who had bipolar disorder for many, many years, and as a family we always struggled to find her care. It seemed like everything was so piecemeal, and it broke our family apart.” Garcia had her own experiences with the mental healthcare system, too. She lost her father to suicide when she was 16 years old, and then she and her family spent years as caregivers for her brother with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder. Sokolin and García were introduced by mutual friends at Stanford because they were both passionate about this area. The pair knew the system could be better. They launched Amae Health in 2022 to be a new approach to helping patients with severe mental illness. Amae brings resources — including family and individual therapy, social workers, psychiatric care and medicine management — all under one roof. One physical roof, that is, as Amae is focused on an in-person approach. The startup hired Dr. Scott Fears, who had experience with this all-encompassing care approach through his work with the Los Angeles Veterans Affair Hospital, so they could iterate on and improve an existing model as opposed to starting a new one from scratch. Amae Health just raised a $15 million Series A round led by Quiet Capital with participation from Healthier Capital, former One Medical CEO Amir Dan Rubin’s firm; Baszucki Group and Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, in addition to all of the company’s seed investors. The startup currently has one clinic in Los Angeles and plans to use the capital to expand. Its next center will be in Raleigh, North Carolina, with locations in Houston, Ohio and New York to follow shortly after. The funds will also be used to continue building out the company’s data platform. Sokolin said the company is using AI to go through the troves of data it collects at its clinic to find ways they can continue to improve care. Over the past few years, many startups have launched to improve the mental healthcare system, but Amae Health’s focus area and approach stand out. Most of the mental health startups that launched in the pandemic are digital first and focused on anxiety and depression. Amae looks very different. There’s nothing wrong, of course, with having a slate of companies focused on anxiety and depression, and it’s good to see founders focused on helping people with severe mental illness, too. Severe mental health problems affect 14.1 million people in the U.S., according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But there’s a lot less innovation in the sector. That’s not too surprising: Solutions for people with severe mental illness don’t perfectly fit a traditional venture model in the way many telemedicine and digital solutions do. People with severe mental illness need care that is in person, making solutions more costly and slower to scale. “When we first went out to raise money, a lot of venture investors were asking, why are you doing this in person? Why is this not virtual?” Sokolin said. “The fact of the matter is you can’t treat someone who is having delusions or auditory hallucinations virtually. The same way you can’t treat cancer virtually, you can’t treat this virtually.” The nature of the business also means that they aren’t expanding to all 50 states right away as some digital health startups have been able to. García said the company is fine with that because it’s more focused on the outcomes than the scaling. “That is about intentional growth and scale, not the winner-take-all market, but really being considerate and conscious about how we do grow and ensuring we are generating lasting change and recovery in these individuals’ lives,” Garcia said. Trying to scale too fast has hurt some mental health startups. Therapy telemedicine platform Cerebral has come under fire for how it advertises to potential customers and how it handles patient data in its pursuit of scale. This slower growth approach can and has worked in venture before, said Sokolin, a former VC at both the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Health2047. One Medical, a full-service healthcare system, including in-person care, is a prime example. The company raised more than $500 million before getting scooped up by Amazon for $3.9 billion. It’s not surprising the former CEO is a current investor in Amae. Sokolin and García are fine with the fact that their approach has turned off some potential investors. They are focused more on building a system for quality care, not just how many patients they can see. “There are way more individuals than anyone could ever treat,” Sokolin said about the scope of individuals with severe mental illness. “We are never going to treat anything more than a small fraction, but we want to be the best-in-class provider for those members.”"
2024-03-05,"This Swedish startup wants to reduce the cost, and controversy, around stem cell production",Biotech & Health,"With the news that “mini organs” have been grown for the first time using human stem cells, this futuristic area of bio-medicine is clearly accelerating by leaps and bounds. However, harvesting stem cells is a controversial process, since a major method involves harvesting during pregnancy. Now a Swedish startup has raised VC investment to take a new process for generating stem cells (from adult volunteer-donated bone marrow), hailed as a revolutionary tool to alleviate and prevent a wide variety of medical conditions, to industrial-scale levels. In an exclusive to TechCrunch, Stockholm-based Cellcolabs revealed it has now raised $8.7 million, taking the total amount it has raised to $21.5 million since its founding in 2021. To date, most stem cells are harvested from adult stem cells or post-termination fetal tissue. The news yesterday detailed how researchers at UCL and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London extracted stem cells that had passed into the amniotic fluid, which surrounds the child in the womb and protects it during pregnancy. But, for obvious reasons, regulations restrict when these fetal samples can be obtained. In countries like the U.S., fetal sampling is, in fact, completely illegal. The clinical-stage biotechnology startup raised the round from a number of investors, including Swedish investors Fredrik Österberg and Jens von Bahr (Österberg co-founded Evolution AB with von Bahr in 2006, which sells casino solutions to online operators). Previous investors include Norrsken Launcher, and the founders of Avito, Jonas Nordlander and Filip Engelbert. The funding will be used to scale up R&D, operations and business development. Cellcolabs originated from the pioneering stem cell research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc at the world-renowned Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, most famous for handing out the Nobel Prize in medicine. Founders Per Båtelson and Maria Rankka, and impact investor Norrsken, joined with Professor Le Blanc to create Cellcolabs, and brought in medically trained Mattias Bernow as CEO. Cellcolabs will specialize in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are scarce and expensive. According to a statement by the company, these are a type of stem cell with anti-inflammatory, regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, which can “promote the healing of damaged tissue and regulate immune responses to reduce inflammation — an underlying cause of many diseases.” MSCs are also used in the realm of longevity, since inflammation contributes to aging. Cellcolabs claims that its process of harvesting the cells from the bone marrow of healthy volunteer donors could slash the price of MSCs by up to 90% within the next decade through large-scale production. In an interview with TechCrunch, Bernow said, “The promise of stem cells or what it holds, is really mind boggling. For me as a physician, what is really interesting is, of course, if we can use cells to prevent disease. In many cases, I think we will be able to alleviate some of the disease burden.” “We are really about making the cells available. MSCs are extremely expensive, and they’re very hard to come by. We’ve been granted the opportunity to work with one of the world’s most well-known professors in this area, and to some extent, it’s an unfair advantage and a blessing.” Bernow said the company doesn’t have any competitors to the extent of his knowledge, at least not at the industrial scale. However, he admitted that “it’s very hard to know what the Chinese are doing in this arena.” French startup TreeFrog Therapeutics is also working on cell manufacturing, however, its approach is to take cells from the skin or blood and “reprogram” them into stem cells. The company raised $75 million in September 2021. “We’ve built this facility, which we believe is one of the world’s largest facilities, solely dedicated for production of this kind of stem cell. We’re just over 45 people here in Stockholm, and we’ve applied to the Swedish version of the FDA,” said Bernow. “We can supply to anyone who’s serious about doing good research and making it available for patients,” he added. In a statement, investor Fredrik Österberg said, “When it comes to investments, our focus is on companies that boast a strong business case and contribute positively to society. With the 25 years of research of Professor Le Blanc, the promising potential of MSCs for healthcare, and an exceptional team at the helm, Cellcolabs is well-positioned to revolutionize the field of stem cells and healthcare.”"
2023-11-30,Drug discovery startup Pepper Bio hopes to challenge Eroom’s law with new funding,Biotech & Health,"Whether you are a tech optimist or not, you have to acknowledge that progress rarely follows a straight line. While the world keeps getting better at churning semiconductors, we are still struggling to find new drugs to treat resistant diseases, and the process isn’t getting cheaper. Some hope that AI can help, and it likely will — when it comes to biotech, it is much more than a buzzword. But Boston-based drug discovery startup Pepper Bio fell in love with another term: Transomics. Calling itself “the world’s first transomics company,” it hopes that this approach will bring solutions for those suffering from untreated diseases such as certain forms of cancer. “Today, drug development still takes on average 10-15 years of R&D with a cost of production (around $2.5 billion) that has increased dramatically over the last decade despite improvements in technology: this is the concept of Eroom’s law (Moore’s law spelled backwards),” deep tech VC Florian Denis wrote in a recent Medium post. While AI could help uncover new drugs, “the AI analysis is really only as good as the data that you put into it,” Pepper Bio CEO Jon Hu told me. And transomics are part of that data. Transomics may be an emerging term, but the COVID-19 pandemic made us more familiar with some of the layers it encompasses. “There’s currently four different -omics types that we’re working with: DNA, RNA, proteomic data and phosphoproteomic data,” Pepper Bio chief scientist officer Samantha Dale Strasser said. You may have identified the first two as genomics and transcriptomics; as for the last one, phosphoproteomics, she summed it up as “proteins with molecular switches that are added that turn them on and off.” More than each layer in itself, though, what matters to Pepper Bio is to get the full picture. This is also why it prefers to talk about transomics than about multi-omics, which it sees as too disconnected; and why it compares itself to Google Maps. Just like real-time navigation data is richer and therefore much more useful than static maps, Pepper Bio is “bringing the same types of advances to drug discovery — a routing context of activity,” Dale Strasser said. Pharma applications The drug discovery road is particularly tricky to navigate; a study shared by Pepper Bio refers to “an overall failure rate in drug development of over 96%, including a 90% failure rate during clinical development.” If transomics can improve odds of success before the costly clinical trial phase starts, pharmaceutical giants will likely be interested — and Pepper Bio is already on their radar. The biotech startup’s $6.5 million seed round is led by NFX, a VC firm that was already involved in its pre-seed round in 2021 and was also an early backer of Mammoth Biosciences. But it’s perhaps equally noteworthy to see that Merck is also participating in the round, alongside Silverton Partners, Mana Ventures, Tensility Ventures and VSC Ventures. The pharmaceutical firm’s involvement is taking place through Merck Digital Sciences Studio, an initiative aimed at helping healthcare startups bring their innovations to market. This might be just the buffer that Pepper Bio needs to still be able to work with other partners without concerns on their part. Merck’s accelerator, Hu explained, “is basically a forum in which we can have a lot of in-depth discussions with Merck scientists to understand basically what their key problems are; and in return, they have some ability to look at high-level financials, but there’s no details. They don’t get project-level access, they don’t see the data, they don’t even see the topics of particular projects that we have with other [drug] developers.” Working with partners is half of what Pepper Bio does; the other half is its own pipeline, focused on oncology. The seed round is meant to help the company make progress on both sides, up to the point where it will be able to secure more funding, Hu said. “On the internal pipeline side, we are looking for particular assets that we can repurpose. We’ve already identified a number of them; we’re in the process of negotiating either an outright acquisition or […] an option to acquire, so we’ll need to have one of those [to raise a new round]. Most of our partnerships currently are much more limited in nature: they tend to be pilot projects. Before we can raise our next round, we’ll need to have at least one of these convert into a long-term partnership with broader economics.” Besides its pharma industry partners, which it can also support in finding drugs for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, Pepper Bio is collaborating with Stanford’s Felsher Lab to identify and validate therapeutic targets for lymphatic and liver cancers. But the common thread here is not the organs these cancers affect; it is their transomics signature. With poorly targeted drugs, “not only do they [patients] have to suffer through the cancer, but they have to suffer through all the side effects of that drug with none of the benefits.” Better targeted drugs can have higher efficacy with lower toxicity, and this is where Pepper Bio hopes that its approach can make the difference. “I think transomics is the final piece of the puzzle that genomics started about 20 years ago,” Hu said. While there likely won’t be a silver bullet to cure cancer, let alone all untreated diseases, it’s encouraging to see more startups trying novel approaches — and more capital flowing in their direction."
2023-12-15,"In the fight against methane, a key GHG, Valley investors have hit upon an unusual target: Cow burps",Biotech & Health,"What do iconic Valley investors Zachary Bogue and Chris Sacca have in common? They are both trying to stop cows from burping methane. What gives? With the conclusion of COP28, the global talks on the climate crisis, methane is going up the climate tech agenda for investors and startups. Emissions from livestock are the main source of agricultural methane, accounting for roughly one-third of all methane emissions, and most of those are not from the part of the cow you’d expect. In fact, it’s from cow burps. When cows process their feed, they literally breathe out methane gas as part of the rumination process, allowing them to digest the grass and hay which other animals, including us, are unable to digest. And it’s these emissions that agricultural tech and bio tech companies are now starting to target. There is plenty of pressure to do so. Indeed, six of the largest names in dairy farming recently pledged to begin disclosing their methane gas emissions and others are expected to join the scheme. And one of the bigger issues at the most recent COP meeting was a pledge to reduce methane emissions, which are growing rapidly. Methane gas is by far the worst of all the greenhouse gases — far worse than CO2, as methane traps more heat in the atmosphere per molecule than carbon dioxide. The gas stays in the atmosphere for around 12 years — compared to hundreds of years for carbon dioxide — but has roughly 80 times the heating effect of carbon dioxide over 20 years and 27 times more over a 100 years, according to the Expert Panel on Livestock Methane 2023. Its reduction is therefore seen as key to the climate crisis fight. Indeed, there is even a satellite-based “Methane Alert and Response System” (MARS), announced by the UN last year. And a major UN report said “urgent steps” are necessary to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a manageable limit. Now a U.K. company thinks it can tackle the issue. U.K. biotech startup Mootral has raised $48.9 million to date. That figure consists of a Seed round of $11.2 million from investors Lowercarbon Capital (the climate VC started by Chris Sacca), Earthshot Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Third Derivative, Climactic and Climate Capital; a Series A of $12.8 million (led by King Philanthropies which invested $10 million); and a pre-seed family office investment by Thomas Hafner and Carin Beumer of $24.9 million. In a statement, Mootral says it is aiming to scale to feeding 300 million cows with its feed additive by 2033, and claims it could potentially deliver up to 50% methane reductions by 2025 — that’s quite some claim. Thomas Hafner, founder and CEO of Mootral, told me over a call that he aims to “deliver immediate, permanent reductions in methane emissions — and this is happening on farms today.” “The next generation of products needs to be at the milligram scale. Our next generation will do even better. We’re looking to get that up to even 90% reduction.” Mootral also has a scheme called “CowCredits” whereby farmers can take advantage of the carbon credit markets as they reduce the methane emissions of their herd. ClimatePartner, a company that finances climate projects via carbon credits, has signed up to have Mootral in its portfolio of options for clients. The company says its Enterix product (manufactured in Wales) has been trialed at farms in the U.K. and the results published across academic journals, including the Open Journal of Animal Science, Frontiers in Microbiology, The Journal of Animal Science and Translational Animal Science. So how does it work? A dairy cow emits around 500 liters of methane daily, accounting for approximately 3.7 tonnes of CO2eq per year. Mootral says its current Ruminant supplement can reduce methane emissions from dairy cows by up to 38% on commercial farms. One of its competitors is CH4 Global, which raised $29 million in its most recent funding round. CH4 Global — which is backed by the aforementioned Zachary Bogue of DCVC — employs seaweed in cow feed to reduce their methane emissions. Steve Meller, CEO of CH4 Global, said via an email that the company is leveraging this “aquaculture” to address the issue: “We have addressed the demand area through already announced commercial partnerships for South Korea with Lotte for 4 million cattle and a soon to be announced global agriculture company for 9.5 million cattle supply. These two combined result in approximately 80 million tonnes CO2e reductions.” He claimed the feed additive line from CH4 Global (called Methane Tamer) contains Asparagopsis, which the company claims can reduce methane emissions from cows by as much as 90%. Another player in the space is DSM, a Dutch multinational, which recently said it would monitor the environmental footprint of food products containing animal proteins. Whatever the case, it’s clear the climate tech space is overlapping with agtech in unexpected ways in the fight against the climate crisis."
2023-04-27,Chunk Foods close to opening factory to produce ‘millions’ of plant-based steaks,Startups,"The global plant-based foods industry accounted for $8 billion in sales and received $1.2 billion in investment in 2022, according to new figures from the Good Food Institute. Those with recent funding include No Meat Factory, Planetarians, ISH Company and Chunk Foods, which is developing a plant-based alternative protein that mimics the texture and taste of traditional meat, initially steak, and eventually pork, lamb and poultry. Amos Golan, founder and CEO of Chunk Foods, told TechCrunch that while the plant-based market is around $8 billion, the traditional meat market is about $1.4 trillion, which means “we’re not even scratching the surface of the addressable market there.” He founded the company in 2020 while at MIT. Israel-based Chunk Foods took in $15 million in seed funding in November, which Golan said “is the biggest seed round ever for an Israeli plant-based company.” Fall Line Capital led the new investment and was joined by The MIT E14 fund and FootPrint Coalition. Chunk Foods previously raised $2 million in pre-seed funding. Project Eaden’s fiber technology poised to spin threads into whole cuts of ‘meat’ The company develops whole cuts of alternative proteins using fermentation technology and food-grade microorganisms to turn soy and wheat into its proteins. And, yes, Chunk Foods does have some products in the pipeline without those two ingredients for consumers with allergies. Its steak product has no preservatives, additives, cholesterol or GMOs and has 25 grams of protein. Golan said what sets his company apart from other plant-based companies is that Chunk Foods’ proprietary fermentation technology has been able to mimic the texture, color and taste of traditional meat along with the direction and thickness of the fibers and juiciness of the cut. It is also doing this with a shorter and cleaner ingredient list, void of gums and stabilizers often used to thicken and preserve the shape of foods. Its technology has also helped the company bring its costs down to around $5 per steak, which Golan said is near the same price as traditional beef tenderloin. The “economies of scale are not fully there yet,” due to also having to import to the United States. Like other companies in this industry, Chunk Foods is in its early stages. It started its pilot phase in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is still pre-revenue, though its steak product is already being served in New York City restaurants, including Coletta, Anixi and The Butcher’s Daughter. Chunk Foods is deploying the new funds into a new facility in Israel, which Golan touts will be “one of the largest plant-based whole cuts factories in the world.” It is expected to be completed in June, and once it is, will be able to manufacture “millions of steaks” per year, Golan added.

As mentioned, the company is not yet selling its products, but has closed on enough pre-sales that Golan said will keep the new facility busy initially for a couple of months. Funds will also be used to expand its current employee base of 25, with the R&D in Israel and commercial team in the U.S. There is also another, even larger, facility in the works as Chunk Foods eyes retail. Meanwhile, the plant-based meat alternative industry has gone through a roller coaster ride in the past year between layoffs at Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, both among the first generation of companies in the industry, production woes felt by Oatly and other setbacks. Addressing the speculation that the end of the plant-based alternative protein was near, Golan noted that what happened was that tens, if not hundreds, of companies came out with products in this area rapidly to grab a piece of the market, often with products that “were not good enough.” Even with its layoffs earlier this year, Golan pointed to Impossible as a company that has been able to grow rapidly as the plant-based market moved slowly. In 2023, Impossible launched four new products, including three plant-based “chicken” products and a leaner version of its “beef” product. “Some companies are not going to exist for very long,” Golan said. “They’re going to be either absorbed in other companies or they’re going to disappear. The third generation of plant-based companies are offering a better product and are leading the pack. Chunk is with them at the moment. Our products are more reasonably priced for the offering and we communicate better with our consumers.” If you have a juicy tip or lead about happenings in the venture world, you can reach Christine Hall at chall.techcrunch@gmail.com or Signal at 832-862-1051.

2024-02-21,Samphire Neuroscience is building a brain stimulating wearable for period pain,Biotech & Health,"It’s a horrible truth that many women simply endure period pain every month — perhaps relying on painkillers or a hot water bottle to relieve stomach cramps. For others, menstrual pain can be inescapably debilitating — to the point where they have to stay in bed for days each month and wait the pain out, as over-the-counter painkillers don’t provide relief. People who menstruate may also suffer from PMS, the mood swings and emotional sensitivity that can occur in the days leading up to a period. Or from an even more severe mood disorder, PMDD. Beyond the usual advice of trying to have a healthy lifestyle, treatment options for mood swings are pretty limited — and serious sufferers may feel they have no choice but to go on hormonal birth control. (If, indeed they can, given there can be medical risks associated with taking the pill.) What if there was a drug-free and effective way to manage both menstrual pain and mood disorders? One that doesn’t involve popping any pills, let alone resorting to the irreversible treatments sometimes offered for extremely severe pain, such as the surgical removal of a woman’s womb. U.K. medtech startup Samphire Neuroscience is taking an alternative and, it claims “science-backed” approach, to tackling these age-old women’s health issues. It’s developed a head-mounted “therapeutic” wearable that applies a non-invasive, low electrical current type of brain stimulation, called tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation). The wearable targets regions of the brain associated with pain perception and mood regulation to, essentially, reduce sensitivity and block pain signals — applying (non-pharmaceutical) neuromodulation as a targeted treatment for period pain and PMS. How does neurostimulation actually work? The theory behind tDCS is that applying a constant electrical current increases “neuroplasticity”, or the brain’s ability to change and adapt by forming and reorganising synaptic connections. In this women’s health use case, Samphire contends there’s a clear and linear link between hormonal levels and brain “structure and activity” — meaning the menstrual cycle enacts changes in the brain, which can affect “mood, energy, sensitivity and more”. It says this effect can be especially pronounced during the luteal phase, before a woman’s period starts, when hormone levels can be changing a lot — so its brain stimulation device is also designed to be used during this phase of the woman’s cycle. The battery-operated wearable, which it’s calling Nettle, resembles a chunky black headband. The user wears it for treatment sessions over a period of several days (five) before their period starts — which the startup says will alleviate pain and mood symptoms associated with (and around) their next bleed. The device works by targeting electrical current at two regions of the brain Samphire says are associated with menstrual pain and PMS, respectively: Namely, the motor cortex, which it says plays a role in pain perception, and the prefrontal cortex which is associated with mood regulation. So it’s designed to address both physical and psychological symptoms. While brain stimulation has been investigated as an experimental medical treatment for centuries — it’s fair to say with varying degrees of success — the technology has become more established as a treatment for issues like chronic pain. In more recent decades there has also been a surge of interest, and some evidence, in tDCS’ potential for treating depression especially. Here Samphire points, by way of validated commercial example, to a fellow neuro tech U.K. startup as a bit of a pioneer: Flow Neuroscience — which already sells a head-mounted device it claims is clinically proven as more effective for treating depression than antidepressants. But where Flow’s product focuses on using neurostimulation to treat low mood regardless of the person’s sex, Nettle is designed specifically for women, and targets both mood symptoms and period pain. This combination is important as Samphire argues these two symptoms — sensitive mood and pain — are intertwined when it comes to determining how women feel on their period. Hitting the right spots “One thing that we were surprised by is usually [neurostimulation] technology is known, in other conditions, to be highly effective but the reduction that we have seen in pain within a single period’s use is actually very unusual. It’s extremely high,” co-founder and CEO Emilé Radytė tells TechCrunch, noting too that the startup’s technology has been tested on a sample that’s disproportionately female vs the industry. “So it seems that, for women, if you stimulate in the right phase — which in our case is right before your period — that actually really matters. Because instead of needing to stimulate every single day, there seems to be some connection between the way that we perceive pain in different [menstrual] phases.” “Historically, when people tried to improve pain in fibromyalgia using a similar technology — and there’s early promising evidence of that but not yet that much — they struggled to see a huge reduction in pain. Our explanation [for getting opposite results] is that because we also stimulate the mood bit, so essentially, we improve your mood and therefore we improve your way of managing pain in the first place — and then on when on top of that we reduce the pain — that actually makes the biggest difference,” she suggests. “That makes even our product design quite differentiated — and that we almost figured out by chance, down the line. But it obviously leans into the fact that menstruation is both a physical and physiological but also an emotional and kind of psychological process. And [the high pain reduction we’ve seen derives from] being able to stimulate both — improving mood improves your ability to manage pain; and when you’re not in pain, you’re able to better manage your mood — and I think that bi-directionality seems pretty straightforward but it seems to be in our data as well, which is cool.” Radytė is on familiar ground here, bringing a background in neuroscience to attack the problem. She studied at Harvard and Oxford, where she’s working toward a PhD in neuropsychiatry — which includes researching depression treatments (including brain stimulation) and looking at why treatments can work differently for different people. Her co-founder, Alex Cook, meanwhile, trained as an IP lawyer and has startup experience leading a product team — both obviously useful skills to have on tap if you’re commercializing academic research that involves proprietary hardware. Co-founders Emilé Radytė and Alex Cook. Image Credits: Samphire Neuroscience Samphire is also drawing on work done by two research labs focused on brain stimulation and women’s health — one in Australia and one in Brazil — which Radytė explains had looked, separately, at menstrual pain and PMDD, and found strong effects for using this type of technology in both cases. The startup’s idea for advancing their work was to combine the targeted treatments and see if it would compound the benefits. They’ve been backed, since starting work on the problem back in late 2021, by a number of early investors which have contributed to a $2.3 million pre-seed round (and the startup’s first priced equity round). Investors include SOSV, Firstpick, Afterwork, Seaside, Ayuh and CVX Ventures. A number of angels also chipped in, including entities associated with the family of Russell Buckley, ex-chairman of Touch Surgery, founder of Kindred Capital; Dr Pamela Walker, founder of Thena Capital; and Rowena Ironside, founder of Women on Boards UK. “There’s often a misconception that pain is always a physical symptom. But to me, it’s very much a mental symptom. So it does make sense to treat it in the brain,” argues Radytė, delving more into the theory underpinning Samphire’s approach. “Because — with painkillers — you always need to take more painkillers, the more pain you have. Because painkillers are trying to block the receptors that precede the pain. Whereas if you’ve blocked pain sensitivity altogether, it actually doesn’t matter how strong your pain is. That means that we can handle much higher extremes of pain as well — because we’ve changed the perception of the pain in the first place.” “To me brain stimulation devices are the future,” she adds. “Because for any long-term condition… no one wants to constantly take medication. So if we can change that status quo — where women can be dependent on other things [than drugs] to manage their cognitive and physical symptoms — then that has to be the future. Especially because women need to live with these conditions for all of their lives.” As women’s health startups often do, Radytė points to how the bulk of medical research has failed to pay proper attention to sex difference, including — in this period-focused context — not considering how hormonal changes in women could lead to distinct responses to treatments. This has created a situation where women’s health needs are under-researched and even overlooked. And where ‘standard’ treatments women get offered are often suboptimal, since fewer innovations have been developed that cater to them. Hence Samphire Neuroscience is on a mission to close this innovation gap. The Nettle headband is intended as the first in a series of products targeting women’s health, with future therapeutics set to focus on female insomnia and the perimenopause. Its first wearable is not yet available to buy. Indeed, the Nettle headband won’t be available unless/until it obtains a CE mark from European medical device regulators — which Radytė says it’s hoping to gain later this year. (RRP will be €409/£359/$449, per an FAQ on its website.) They intend to sell the device direct to consumers and via retailer partners. Per Radytė, research the startup conducted into women’s attitudes to traditional healthcare providers suggest they continue to have very low trust in doctors to handle these sorts of sex-specific health issues — and are more likely to trust a recommendation from a friend. This is why the startup didn’t want to gate access to the wearable behind a prescription: No doctor’s sign off will be needed to buy it. But the team is hoping the hardware will be reimbursable, via health insurers, in future. (She also says the team is working with doctors, and has clinical advisors, as it continues to develop the product, and intends to sell Nettle through hospitals it’s collaborating with too.) Clinical trial So what proof can the startup show that Nettle really does work? Samphire has undertaken a clinical trial that Radytė says shows “really promising results” for treating period pain and PMS. The study underpins its EU application for medical device certification — where it’s seeking a Class 2A CE marking. The regulatory process entails comparing Nettle’s efficacy for pain relief vs the performance of painkillers, while for mood symptoms it’s compared to antidepressants. So the assessment is comparative vs existing treatment options. “The actual indications for use of our device will be for managing pain associated with menstruation and managing mood symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome,” she notes. “So, specifically, what we claim is an improvement in low mood in the premenstrual period. But we expect to extend that, over time, to also things like irritability and mood swings. But those are just a little bit difficult to test in the way that the EU likes them.” Radytė says the clinical trial it conducted last year as part of the certification application involved collecting pain and mood scores from around 50 people across a menstrual cycle when they did not use its device; and again across a cycle when they used the wearable to deliver brain stimulation for five days before their period (or they were given a sham device which, initially, mimics the sensation of electrical current but does not administer the treatment to correct for any placebo effect). The study also collected scores for the participants’ pain and mood on the subsequent cycle after they had stopped using the headband to see whether there were any lingering effects. “We expect the best kind of use will come out of our device if you use it for at least three months. But here we just wanted to show that even within a very quick amount of time you can see a difference. And what we showed is that, on average, people’s pain decreased by 52% when they were using the active device — and it kept decreasing the month afterwards,” she says, adding: “Those who had the active intervention [i.e. not the sham headband] actually had a much lighter period the following month as well.” While around 50 clinical trial participants might sound low, Radytė argues the size of the trial is appropriate for neurostimulation technology studies — and statistically significant. “Because there’s historical studies on this technology, we could tell how many people you need in order to find statistical significance if there is some and that’s essentially how you define sample sizes,” she explains, adding: “In the field of brain stimulation, everything above 20 is a good sample size — which is why we went for the number we did.” (For the record, Flow Neuroscience’s rival device for depression bases its claims of clinical efficacy on a double blinded placebo controlled clinical trial which it said showed the product to be twice as effective as antidepressants on a study involving around 170 participants.) “What is new, and I think what is really interesting about a product like ours, is we are spending quite a bit of time educating the regulators about where really to put neurotechnology for women’s health,” Radytė continues. “Because at the moment we are categorized very much in the field of neurotechnology and very much in that kind of lump of regulation which is extremely high [in terms of the level of proof required to get certification as a medical device]. “But if you look at the state of the art for women [i.e. for treating period pain and mood] it’s extremely low. And that overlap hasn’t yet been categorized well — which is why we’re almost pushed through much higher regulatory and clinical burdens because we’re evaluated in the technical product category, rather than a kind of public health need category.” While the U.K. is no longer in the EU, as a consequence of Brexit, the country has not rolled out its own alternative system for regulating medical devices. So Samphire expects, once it has obtained the bloc’s CE mark, that it won’t have to repeat the whole application in order to access the U.K. market — but will instead be able to notify the equivalent national body (the MHRA) and get permission to sell Nettle. However, the usual complexities of applying and obtaining clearance from medical regulators apply elsewhere. So Samphire will be focused on selling its wearable across Europe in the first instance, producing an initial run of 1,000 devices to test the water. It does have plans to target the U.S. market in the future — estimating it’s 1.5-2 years away from a U.S. launch. (It plans to apply for a “breakthrough device” designation from the FDA — which will require it to run fresh clinical trials in the U.S. to meet the regulator’s bar, per Radytė.) While brain stimulation might sound a pretty drastic treatment for period pain, safety concerns shouldn’t cause too much pause for thought given the device will only be sold when/if it has satisfied the EU regulator that it doesn’t pose any risk of harm. Asked about safety Radytė also points back to what she says is over 30 years of research into similar technologies, primarily used to treat psychiatric disorders, adding: “There has never been a serious adverse event reported.” What about possible side effects of applying low current neurostimulation? “Mild” side-effects are very common, per Radytė — including itching and tingling the first time treatment is applied (related to the person’s skin reacting to the current). But she suggests most people get accustomed to the treatment and any skin sensitivity goes away. A more serious side-effect she mentions is that some women may get what she calls “transient migraines” — transient because she says they “seem to always dissipate within 30 minutes”. Whether the risk of a fairly brief migraine is a good trade off for the chance of having a better period will depend on a woman’s own experience of their menstrual cycle and any symptoms they regularly suffer. For some, the risk of a short headache once a month might sound a lot more manageable than what they usually have to go through. For others, a hot water bottle and bed rest might still be all they need. Those who suffer the worst levels of period pain should be aware that Nettle’s website stipulates the device is not intended as a treatment for people who’ve had a specific diagnosis of endometriosis — a condition that can cause extremely painful periods — but the startup still suggests the device may help alleviate some of the pain they experience. Product design & fit Some practical considerations: As Nettle is worn on the head it will typically have to function through hair. The user needs to spray a saline solution onto conductive sponges on the underside of the band to ensure the current flows properly during the 20-minute treatment session. However — currently — it does not work if the user has Afro hair that’s worn in “thick braids”, according to Radytė. But she says it will work through loosely braided or finely braided Afro hair. (She also notes that well over half (67%) of its sample of testers for the clinical trial were non-white, adding: “That was really important to us from a diversity of hair perspective and hair product perspective.”) The headband itself is designed to be extremely simple to put on and use, to avoid the risk of a person incorrectly applying the treatment. So it has no wires and just a single button to activate the neurostimulation treatment. While the shape of the band is designed to target the correct brain regions, regardless of a person’s head size and shape. Radytė says the team spent a long time on the hardware design — trying to achieve something that looks pretty enough the user could wear the band to work or out and about without feeling self conscious. So while it’s fairly nondescript and minimal looking, that was really the goal. In the field of neuro tech making a device that doesn’t stick out and look ugly is innovative in and of itself, she argues. Samphire is also developing an app to work with the wearable — powering notifications to remind the user when it’s time to apply their treatment. The app will also include a period tracking function and offer users the ability to participate in future research projects the startup wants to undertake out to boost understanding of period issues and “give back the community”, as she puts it. One interesting question will be the scale of demand for Samphire’s product. Therapeutic wearables are still fairly novel (tracking wearables are far more common). And while, across Europe, millions of women are of menstruating age and many of them will suffer some sort of period pain, it’s less clear what proportion regularly experience periods so horribly miserable that they’d be willing to invest this much in a treatment device. Samphire cites stats suggesting 90% of women suffer some form of PMS (acute to mild) and 91% suffer pain (period cramps or dysmenorrhea) during menstruation itself. It also notes endometriosis affects 10% of women globally and PMDD between 5% and 8%. But, again, these sort of general statistics don’t provide a detailed picture of how much pain and misery women routinely suffer through — and whether, therefore, there might be mass or niche demand for a period-pain wearable. If the startup gains regulatory certification and is able to prove the worth of its approach, there could be potential for scaling sales via a B2B2C model, though. As well as getting health insurers to reimburse the product, it could — for example — pitch employers on subsidizing Nettle to offer female employees as a support measure which could also help reduce the need for staff to take menstrual sick days.

2024-05-29,Mental health insurance platform ifeel raises a $20 million Series B,Biotech & Health,"Mental health issues like stress, depression and anxiety can lead to work-related illnesses, absences and long-term sick leave. But many companies think offering a gym membership is enough. ifeel — a European startup that decided mental health should be tackled differently and which raised $6.6 million in 2021 — has now raised a $20 million Series B investment co-led by FinTLV Ventures and Korelya Capital. In total, ifeel has raised $40 million since its inception. Initially founded in 2017 as a consumer-focused therapy platform, ifeel pivoted to allow businesses to offer staff support during the pandemic and segued into being offered as part of an employer’s or insurance provider’s healthcare cover. It competes with companies like Modern Health. “When you enter into our platform, the first part is a digital assessment that is a co-pilot of an AI system that we built,” CEO Amir Kaplan told me. “So we actually can evaluate the risk of the person when they come into the platform and predict what is the best level of care.” “After this assessment, we will give a recommendation of the best treatment that starts from mild up to high-risk cases and our goal is to identify the high risk cases to prevent them from having a dramatic impact on the person and then on the company. But we also prevent cases that are starting and companies are able to help them in a scalable way.” Poor mental health is an enormous business and societal issue, costing England alone £300 billion a year, according to research by the U.K.-based Centre for Mental Health think tank. Gil Arazi, founder and managing partner of FinTLV Ventures, said in a statement: “This investment … supports our thesis that the insurance industry should prioritize prevention and preventative solutions.”"
2024-02-28,Sweanty’s wearable patch for athletes tracks salt loss to help them hydrate,Biotech & Health,"Wearables are coming in an increasing array of shapes, form factors and guises these days as health and fitness tracking proliferates. Here at 4YFN at the MWC tradeshow we spotted a new one: A stick-on patch for tracking athletes’ sweat to monitor salt loss and help them tailor their rehydration strategy. The Spanish startup behind these (currently) single-use wearables is called Sweanty (yes, that’s not a typo). “We do personalized hydration plans for athletes — and these plans are based on analysis of their sweat,” said co-CEO and founder Laura Ortega Tañá, explaining the system is designed to ensure athletes re-hydrate with the correct amount of electrolytes (or isotonic drinks) after each training session. Analysis of the patch wearers’ “sweatprofile” is sent to a companion app where they access their tailored hydration plan. This does mean the athlete needs to use a new patch every time they train. Or at least check in at key points over their training season (such as when temperatures are changing). So the cost of the tracking will certainly stack up. But pro athletes whose day job is pushing their edge are used to investing in their own performance. Proper hydration can boost sportspeople’s performance by helping to maintain energy levels and endurance, as well as reducing the risk of cramps, per Ortega Tañá. It can also help with temperature regulation. Sweanty’s wearables are not yet available for athletes to buy but the startup expects to launch them in Spain by the end of April. Pricing isn’t confirmed either — but she suggests it will be in the region of €120 for a box of three patches (plus three months’ access to the subscription tracking service). The version of the wearable on show here at MWC is designed to be worn on the skin at the base of the back. Trail runners are an early focus for the startup but the patch could work for all sorts of endurance and performance sports. (Swimmers or other sports where the user is immersed in water are an exception; they will have to stick with manual methods for tracking salt loss such as weighing themselves before and after their session.) The team is also working on an iteration of the patch that will allow the electronics components to be retained after every use, with only part of the device having to be disposed of after use. The sweat analysis technology was developed and patented during Ortega Tañá’s PhD. She highlights a paper-based salt measurement method as a particular novelty here — with the device essentially being woken up when it comes into contact with the user’s sweat. “The type of measurement that we’re doing is with a paper-based method. We are using a battery with two electrodes on a paper inside and when the paper is completely dry it’s not working. But when it absorbs sweat it gives power that is directly related to the amount of salts involved,” she told TechCrunch. While athletes are a fairly narrow addressable market, Ortega Tañá suggested the technology could have wider applications, such as for fitness-conscious consumers who are active enough to want to monitor their hydration. Or for worker safety use cases, such as for people who work in very warm conditions, like construction workers or firemen, where there may be an occupational health risk. “The only requirement that we need is that they sweat,” she added. Alerting caregivers to dehydration risk in seniors who may not be drinking enough is another potential use case she mentioned. However in that scenario she said the wearable would need to be reengineered so it could actively stimulate the wearer’s sweat reflex to be able to monitor them for salt loss."
2023-08-14,Mixlab adds to veterinary pharmacy footprint following $10M Series A extension,Biotech & Health,"The global pandemic showed most of us how easy it was to get items delivered to our homes, and that expanded into anything we needed for our pets, too. And as more pets find homes, with it grows the global pet care industry, now expected to reach $368 billion by 2030, and so grows the need for more veterinary services. Dozens of companies are infusing technology into the care aspect — for example, Airvet, Digitail, The Vets and Dutch — while Mixlab is working on the pharmacy side offering pet prescription and wellness solutions. Today, Mixlab announced $10 million in additional funding to meet some of that demand. Vanterra Ventures led the round and was joined by Lakehouse Ventures. Ellis Fried, vice president of Vanterra Ventures, is joining Mixlab’s board of directors as part of the investment. In total, Mixlab has raised $40 million, Fred Dijols, company founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. We profiled the company in 2021 when it raised $20 million in Series A funding. Its proprietary technology was designed to help veterinarians digitally write and manage prescriptions, while giving pet owners proactive text-based communication on the status of those prescriptions and free next-day delivery in all 50 states. Mixlab raises $20M to provide purrfect pharmacy experience for pet parents Two years ago, the company was operating in New York and Los Angeles, and has since amassed thousands of veterinarian and pet owner customers. Among that are 2,000 clinics that are active users of Mixlab, said Libby Loskota, the company’s senior vice president of sales and market. In the last year, Mixlab’s sales grew 50% year over year, and it brought on Loskota, who previously led TaskUs’ global marketing, and former Ro chief operating officer George Koveos as its new COO. The new investment, an extension of those Series A dollars, enables the company to open another location in the Miami area. In addition, while Mixlab started as a compounding pharmacy, it has expanded into new product offerings, including branded and generic medications and over-the-counter products catered to pet health and wellness. Dijols also intends to deploy the new funding into operations and product offering expansion, technology development and to reach profitability, which he said is near. “On the sales and marketing side, we’ve got a playbook that works on the operation side, and we know how to create a new facility and contribution margins,” Dijols told TechCrunch. “On the technology side, now we have a way for veterinarians to make revenue and an API, so all of that is coming into place. Now we’re at a point where we can finally put capital to work to enhance our technology platform and continue to create features for veterinarians and pet parents.” Pitch Deck Teardown: Alto Pharmacy’s $200M Series E deck"
2024-01-13,Age tech at CES was much more than gadgets,Biotech & Health,"W elcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here. There was a lot going on in tech this week, and not just CES. But yes, CES was definitely worth watching closely, if only just for the rise of age tech. — Anna Better aging Following CES from a distance this year, I couldn’t help but notice how age tech, or silver tech, companies seemed to be in the spotlight — perhaps more than we expected. For instance, I read that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had visited the booth of AgeTech Collaborative, an initiative from U.S. senior advocacy group AARP to showcase “groundbreaking age tech innovations” during the event. @Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella visited our #CES2024 booth, exploring the AI-driven ElliQ by Intuition Robotics. Tech giants meet #AgeTech innovation! #MicrosoftAtCES #AgeTechTrends pic.twitter.com/OA2GXKD5fw — AgeTech Collaborative™ from AARP (ILabs) (@AgeTechCollab) January 10, 2024 The robot that Nadella met there is one I’ve met, too: ElliQ, an AI-enabled companion for older adults. Its parent company, Intuition Robotics, recently gave it an upgrade; nicknamed ElliQ 3, “the latest version of the robot features design tweaks, more powerful hardware and — of course — generative AI integration,” my colleague Brian Heater reported. The ElliQ eldercare robot gets a hardware upgrade, generative AI for improved conversations It’s not just at the AARP booth where age tech is on display, and the trend is global. There’s Tack One, from Singapore, with its location tracker for children and seniors. And there are at least three companies — Safe-Living, Serenity and Zoe Care — applying different approaches to the same problem: keeping older people safe by detecting falls. I met Safe-Living CEO Sandro Cilurzo at TechCrunch Disrupt last year and was quite impressed by the demo that he showed me. (This isn’t just a figment of his imagination; the company’s device and app are already very much in use by B2B and B2C customers in Switzerland.) Since avoiding false alarms is critical, Safe-Living’s technology is fine-tuned to know that a senior may be lying on the ground for their weekly yoga session, for instance. On the other hand, it may raise the alarm if that same person can’t get out of bed in the morning; beyond falls, it is focused on detecting helplessness situations. CES 2024 marks Safe-Living’s second participation under the Swiss flag, and Cilurzo saw more inbound interest for age tech this time around. Compared to 2023, he received more meeting requests from associations and individuals scouting for solutions related to caregiving. It could be because Safe-Living has been on an upward trajectory, too. Since Disrupt, Cilurzo landed his first U.S. B2B customer and is gearing up to launch its B2C offering there in the spring under a new brand called helpany. But there’s more, with a broad range of companies enjoying tailwinds. “Age tech definitely feels some momentum, but more importantly, the momentum seems to be stemming from the industry itself. It is clearly perceivable that advanced technological solutions seem to be embraced more and more by the healthcare industry. The perception has shifted from “gadgets to a massive opportunity of value-add,” Cilurzo told me in an email. Of course, it doesn’t hurt, either, when you can surf the AI hype as well. “Using AI is definitely helping us this year, more than in 2023,” Cilurzo said when we hopped on a call. But unlike some weird AI-enabled gadgets on showcase at CES, Safe-Living has been using AI since the very beginning and with an equally real use case. The more it happens, the better for CES and for everyone else. Venture debt back in fashion? Not everyone is fond of venture debt. The panelists of a roundtable I moderated at TechCrunch Disrupt last year certainly weren’t. For instance, Hadrian CEO Chris Power shared a warning with the many founders in the audience: “Unless you’re in real trouble, I would avoid venture debt at almost all costs.” Well, startup finance company Arc Technologies still believes in the value prop of venture debt, especially in current times. As my colleague Christine Hall reported, its Arc Capital Markets venture debt marketplace will help companies “receive indicative debt terms for up to $250 million within five days from a network of lenders” — saving them time and money. Arc wants to make venture debt popular again “We want to help founders and CFOs weather the ongoing storm in the venture capital funding route and ensure that they’re continuing to grow efficiently with minimal dilution,” CEO Don Muir told Christine. AI reshaping biotech DeepMind’s AI-enabled drug discovery spinout Isomorphic Labs signed partnerships potentially worth $3 billion with Eli Lilly and Novartis, my colleague Kyle Wiggers reported. Isomorphic inks deals with Eli Lilly and Novartis for drug discovery Having discussed with Israeli fund Grove Ventures how there might be more than one winner in AI-enabled drug discovery, I knew general partner Renana Ashkenazi wouldn’t see this as bad news for Grove’s portfolio. Instead, she gave me more context as to why Eli Lilly and Novartis were keen to partner with Isomorphic. “AI is really starting to reshape the biotech industry,” Ashkenazi said. “Innovation and progress towards a detailed model of human cells, combined with the fact that big pharma’s returns on R&D are not as good as they used to be, create a unique market opportunity. In the near future, we will see more big pharma companies increasing AI-driven drug discovery and development activities,” she predicted. Mixed reality When I wrote last week about the (re)emergence of the metaverse, we didn’t know when the Apple Vision Pro headset would be available. It now has a U.S. launch date: February 2. But preorders start earlier — on January 19 at 5 a.m. PT. — so that may be the date you want to save . . . if you can afford the $3,500 price tag."
2024-06-25,Foray Bioscience is breaking down the barriers of bringing biomanufacturing to plants,Climate,"Ashley Beckwith spent years of her academic and professional career focused on the intersection of biology, materials and manufacturing to build medical solutions more efficiently. When she realized the tech could be applied to plants and plant-based materials, an area that desperately needed it, she decided to switch gears. “Life on earth is only as secure as our global plant populations, and today our plant populations are really in crisis,” Beckwith told TechCrunch. “Nearly 40% of our plant species are threatened by extinction. Forest landscapes unscathed by humans shrunk 12% [in 2022]. These plant resources are being squeezed on all fronts.” Beckwith took what she knew about biomanufacturing, the process of using microorganisms and cell cultures to produce biological molecules and materials on a commercial scale, and launched Foray Bioscience in February 2022. The company uses biomanufacturing to grow harvest-free plant-based materials, seeds and molecules. Biomanufacturing has been around for about 100 years, Beckwith said, but it hasn’t had many practical use cases for plants thus far. Because each plant species is so different, there wasn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to cultivate cells, which made biomanufacturing with plant cell cultures laborious. Foray looks to change that through its database approach; it provides predictive insights and experimental direction to help speed up the research and development process for each plant species. “At Foray, we are developing these advanced tools for plant-less production to ask less of these resources and start to give back more,” Beckwith said. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup raised a $3 million seed round led by ReGen Ventures, an Australian firm focused on backing technology that helps restore the planet’s resources. Engine Ventures, Understorey Ventures and Superorganism also participated in the round. The startup has now raised $3.875 million in total funding and plans to build out its team. Beckwith said that it took a while to fundraise the round because what the company is trying to do doesn’t fit squarely into one category but rather at the intersection of many, from manufacturing to biology to conservation. This “odd ball” feeling is something Beckwith is used to running up against. She said that the reason she launched the company to begin with is that there wasn’t a natural home for the research she was doing in plant biomanufacturing. “I was in this weird cross-disciplinary bubble,” Beckwith said. “That was really apparent to me when I got toward the end of my PhD. If this research was going to move forward and progress, I had to carry it forward into the next iteration of itself. Because of the newness of the field, there wasn’t really a home for it in the academic setting or manufacturing setting. We had to make our own space.” She described taking the science out of the lab and launching the company as a “long journey.” The startup currently is working with other companies to help them set up their biomanufacturing by designing their clients a research and development roadmap and helping them develop commercialization strategies. Beckwith also has a vision that this work will allow Foray to create a genetic banking system for plant seeds, especially those that aren’t easy to document, and allow new seeds to be grown from just a few cells. This will help with conservation efforts, too. There are many parallels between Foray’s tech and mission and the rise of lab-grown meat and seafood. While the science isn’t exactly the same, Beckwith said, both have the same goal of replacing products and resources that humans are used to getting from nature with a lab-grown option that’s less harmful to natural environments. While lab-grown meat is a little further along in the journey, Beckwith is optimistic about Foray’s future. “With the scale of the growing human population, and our growing demands on natural resources, it’s really important for us to be as efficient with those natural resources as possible so we can keep them around for the long-term,” Beckwith said. “This tool really allows us to move past the natural constraints that exist in the wider world and get more from less so that we can reduce our footprint on these natural resources, but still have access to the goods we need to survive as a society.”"
2023-01-11,Predictions for the longevity industry in 2023,Biotech & Health,"Abby Miller Levy Contributor Abby Miller Levy is the managing partner and founding president of Primetime Partners. She formerly served as the SVP of strategy and growth at SoulCycle and founded Thrive Global with Arianna Huffington. Last year was when we all got the wake-up call about longevity. From major reports published on the impact of longevity by the National Academy of Medicine and McKinsey to every leading newspaper, public discourse highlighted how our global healthcare, financial and housing infrastructure was failing to serve a rapidly growing older adult population. While this demographic data is not new, from kitchen table talk to Congress, there was a heightened call for urgency and immediate action. At Primetime, we observed this wake-up call beyond the research and media attention. First, our deal flow of early-stage businesses in the sector increased from 70 in Q4 2021 to 120 in Q4 2022. And, we were one of only three dedicated funds investing in aging and longevity when we launched in 2020, but we are now aware of at least six more agetech funds in formation, in addition to many other existing funds keen to expand their team to cover the sector. We are very optimistic for 2023 as we see incredible founder momentum, untapped areas to build new businesses and a window to an increasingly tech-accessible, rapidly growing consumer market. Here are our top predictions for the longevity industry in 2023. Health span is the new life span The COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on older adult behavior with regard to technology usage, penetration of telemedicine and remote health monitoring, early retirement and financial insecurity. Sadly, one of the harshest implications of the pandemic was that life expectancy in the U.S. declined to 77 from 79. This year will shift the conversation from “life span” to “health span” — how we live healthier for longer. While telemedicine usage has declined from its peak during the pandemic, the new average is much higher than before the pandemic. We are particularly excited about companies that will accelerate the growth of 100+ primary and specialty-care telemedicine startups by managing their technology, patient payments and reimbursement, as well as provider acquisition and certification. In an effort to prevent costly hospital visits, the past few years have seen a proliferation of startups offering supplemental health plan benefits for older adults — from transportation to home modification. This year, we will see a shift from the mere availability of benefits to the utilization of benefits provided by health plans and the government. Companies that offer personalized care outreach and incentive programs are leading this emphasis on benefits management. Global demand for monitoring hardware for chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease and respiratory diseases) is expected to triple in the next six years. We’re seeing a new wave of monitoring solutions focused on diagnosis and prevention, such as at-home blood tests, hormone tracking and cognitive decline diagnostic tests. Mature women’s care will also see significant consolidation as healthcare players look to increase the ways they help women with menopause. With many new entrants in the estimated $600 billion menopause category, these early stage businesses will be prime for acquisition. In 2023, we will see a slew of new dementia care solutions. With at least four digital therapeutics in the FDA’s queue and an increase in annual Alzheimer’s and dementia research funding to $3.5 billion in 2022, there will be a steady stream of new dementia interventions. The home In 2022, the term “aging in place” became normalized, fueled by a slew of hospital-at-home startups and persistent consolidation in the home health sector. This will continue in 2023, complemented by new fintech and proptech solutions. We will see traction in the evolution of long-term care insurance as Americans realize they must privately fund their in-home care assistance. New players will partner with incumbent insurance companies to offer hybrid products. Similarly, to afford to age in place, new home financing and equity products will gain in popularity. I also expect to see more real estate mobility as folks downsize, looking for relocation and property management services. The confusion, localization and inefficiencies of downsizing should and can be solved by entrepreneurs. The workplace In the face of silent resignations, employers normalized remote work and expanded well-being benefits. To retain talent, more businesses will offer employees of all ages greater access to retirement benefits, family caregiving and bereavement support — a boon for startups across those industries. As the humongous boomer generation reaches retirement age, there will be an emphasis on 401(k)s and IRAs. The space will continue to expand as new legislation forces businesses to offer retirement plans. This year will usher in the second wave of retirement innovators, which some call retire tech, who are creating more flexible and compelling products. In 2024, age diversity will become an agenda item as employers seek to retain and reengage the wisdom and skills of an experienced workforce. The zeitgeist Finally, 2023 will see a more positive light being cast on aging and older adults. Ageism and tired characterizations of older adults as frail and immobile are out, replaced by boomers in their 50s, 60s and 70s living their best life. In fact, by 2030, the 50-plus market is projected to swell to 132 million people, who are projected to spend an average of $108 billion every year on tech products. A spark has been lit. We cannot wait to see how these themes continue to evolve over the course of 2023."
2023-04-26,"Amazon closing Halo health division, lays off staff while offering hardware refunds",Hardware,"Amazon sent out a note to Halo customers today announcing that it is shutting down its Halo Health division, effective July 31. Included in the announcement is news of layoffs, as well as full refunds on hardware purchased over the past 12 months. That includes Amazon Halo View, Halo Band, Halo Rise and a bunch of accessories. That’s not an unprecedented move (Google did something similar when it recently shut down Stadia), but it’s a sign of good will for customers and a tacit acknowledgement that the hardware won’t be worth a hell of a lot when its associated services shut down. The company will also be ending subscription fees and refunding those that were pre-paid. “At Amazon, we think big, experiment, and invest in new ideas like Amazon Halo in our efforts to delight customers,” the company notes in a letter addressed to “Halo Member.” As of the beginning of August, all of the aforementioned products will cease to function. Amazon has also tossed in information for recycling the hardware and saving scan images to a phone’s camera roll. Those impacted by layoffs, on the other hand, don’t appear to have received much warning: We notified impacted employees in the U.S. and Canada today. In other regions, we are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies and possibly result in longer timelines to communicate with impacted employees. For employees who are impacted by this decision, we are providing packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support. At the end of last month, the company announced 9,000 layoffs, adding to 18,000 it made beginning in January. Amazon’s hardware divisions were disproportionately impacted by the first round, with strong focuses on the Alexa/Echo team. The original Halo tracker was greeted with privacy pushback when it was announced in August 2020. A few months later, we spoke to Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar about the concerns. “I really do think there’s got to be rules in place,” she told TechCrunch at the time. “The reason I’m writing HHS is because they should play a larger role in ensuring data privacy when it comes to health, but between the HHS and the Federal Trade Commission, they’ve got to come up with some rules to safeguard private health information. And I think the Amazon Halo is just the ultimate example of it, but there’s a number of other devices that have the same issues. I’m thinking there’s some state regulations going on and things like that, and we just need federal standards.” The line still grew quickly, adding the Halo View, an $80 Fitbit competitor, in late 2021, alongside additional fitness and nutrition programs. Last September, it announced the Halo Rise, a bedside sleep tracker, which went on sale at the end of the year."
2023-06-23,UK touts £21M fund to extend AI deeper into the National Health Service,AI,"The AI revolution has swung full-force into the mainstream conversation this year, powered by consumer-friendly generative AI applications such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But while such tools are raising myriad legal and ethical questions, the emergence of new and powerful large language models (LLMs) also have the potential to revolutionize healthcare. This is why the U.K. government today announced that it’s committing £21 million ($26.75 million) to National Health Service (NHS) trusts, which can apply for funding to “accelerate the deployment of the most promising AI tools” in hospitals across the country. It’s worth noting that the NHS has courted controversy in the past over its dabblings in the AI realm, with a U.K. data regulator ruling back in 2017 that a data-sharing partnership the NHS had struck with Google’s DeepMind’s broke privacy laws. This led to a class-action lawsuit against Google, which was ultimately tossed out by a U.K. court earlier this year. But with recent advances in AI and LLMs, the U.K. has been pushing to position itself at the center of the AI gold rush, launching “global” summits, million-pound prizes for AI development, tech company-friendly guidelines (rather than legislation) around AI development and a £100 million pot to develop AI models for use in areas such as education and healthcare. And earlier this month, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that AI juggernauts OpenAI, Google’s DeepMind and Anthropic were to provide “early or priority access” to all their AI models as a means to support research into evaluation and safety of the AI. Decision-support Now, the U.K. has launched its so-called AI Diagnostic Fund to bring “the most promising AI imaging and decision-support tools” to diagnose and treat patients with heart conditions, cancer and strokes. Indeed, the government said that it wants to deploy AI tools across all NHS stroke networks by the end of this year, having already used AI to support clinical decision making in for several years already — prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which stretched the NHS to its limits. “The use of AI decision support software in the initial stages of stroke care means patients get interventions quicker, reducing the likelihood of disability and saving the brains,” said Dr. Deb Lowe, national clinical director for stroke medicine at NHS England, in a statement. “We are already seeing the positive impact of AI decision support software on stroke care, where rapid assessment and treatment are of the essence, and we now have real world evidence of the benefit for NHS patients.” On top of that, the government says that it’s also looking to use AI to analyze chest x-rays, which will help clinicians detect early signs of lung cancer — the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.K., killing more than 35,000 people each year. According to the U.K.’s department of health and social care, NHS Trusts will be able to apply for funds for “any AI diagnostic tool” that Trusts see fit to deploy, though it will have to justify its request in terms of value-for-money."
2023-01-02,This startup brings Southeast Asia’s vacant hospital rooms into the sharing economy,Biotech & Health,"Uber and Airbnb have long been the poster children for the sharing economy. In other realms of society, entrepreneurs are also trying to match demand with untapped assets and services. HD, a startup based out of Bangkok, is applying the economic model to healthcare in Southeast Asia. HD operates a platform that helps three parties meet: surgeons with private practice, patients looking to have their surgeries done more cheaply, and vacant surgery rooms at hospitals. The model might sound a bit counterintuitive to people in the West, but Southeast Asia’s medical system is built on very different patient-hospital dynamics. Sheji Ho, co-founder and CEO of HD, conceived the idea when he saw surgeons in Thailand advertising on Facebook to attract private customers. Dual practice is “very common” for doctors in Southeast Asia, observed Ho, who previously co-founded the Southeast Asian e-commerce enabler aCommerce. “They get the credential from working for top hospitals, but they are paid poorly, so they also work at private ones where they get the money,” he says in an interview. In Southeast Asia, people go straight to the hospital when they get sick. The problem with public hospitals, Ho reckons, is they have very long queues, so doctors try to lure patients to the private institutions where they work. “Doctors [in the region] are kind of like merchants who operate across different platforms,” he says. Forty percent of Southeast Asia’s health spending was paid out of pocket in 2018, according to the World Health Organization, compared to 29.8% in Europe and 32.4% in the Americas. Since there’s no central platform providing cost transparency, patients often end up paying a steep price. When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, swathes of surgical rooms suddenly got freed up as Thailand, a popular destination for medical tourism, lost international patients. The oversupply was exacerbated by the country’s hospital-building spree before the pandemic, Ho noted, as the government bet on an aging population and increased land value. “Organically, hospitals wanted to use our platforms,” Ho says. And since HD is bringing customers to them, it can bargain for lower room rates. Patients getting surgeries such as thyroid, hemorrhoid, and orthopedic surgery through HD are paying 15% to 20% less than market prices. Why not provide a meeting point for all these needs? Hence HD launched its HDcare private-label surgery service two months ago. The platform is now sitting on a supply of over 20 operating rooms across Thailand and Indonesia, according to Ho, with the potential to access more from 1,500 healthcare providers already on its platform, and it has over 40 types of surgeries lined up. The plan is to scale the service to 200 surgeries performed per quarter by Q4 2023. Amazon for health services HD’s surgery platform is a new addition to its established business, a marketplace for outpatient services. The model has proven successful in the massive healthcare market in neighboring China, where JD.com, Alibaba’s domestic archrival, runs a similar e-commerce operation selling third-party healthcare services like vaccinations, checkups, imaging sessions, and minor surgeries. The absence of primary care in Southeast Asia means people either need to ask their friends for recommendations or do several rounds of hospital hopping before landing the right doctor and treatment. That’s a contrast to the U.S., where 75% of adults had primary care physicians as of 2015 to treat common conditions and are referred to hospitals only for urgent and specialist treatment. Like Airbnb, HD began onboarding hospitals and clinics through a lot of heavy lifting, like helping customers set up their product pages. “But that’s also our moat,” says Ho. “SaaS is still too early for Southeast Asia.” HD takes a cut from transactions and charges a listing fee from healthcare providers, similar to how a conventional e-commerce platform monetizes. It also offers healthcare marketing solutions to providers on its platform, similar to how Amazon Ads and Tmall Ads enable brands to increase their reach and performance. The liability of platform operators is an ongoing debate in the tech industry, and a business that could influence one’s health seems to make the matter even trickier. As a marketplace platform, HD doesn’t deal with disputes in general; in the beauty space where the experience may be more “subjective,” HD takes an approach similar to that of Amazon whereby it “puts patients first, refunds customers and deals with the providers directly,” says the founder. “In general, HD prioritizes minimally invasive, short-stay, elective surgeries that have low output variation such as thyroid and hemorrhoid surgery, in addition to outpatient procedures.” Since its founding four years ago, HD has served around 250,000 patients. It saw a 7x sales growth during the pandemic and aims to keep its growth rate at 2–3x growth in the post-COVID years. Optimism in recession While the pandemic is taking a toll on the global economy, Ho is optimistic about his own venture. “Whenever a recession started, we saw some businesses take off. They were leveraging excess supply. Groupon was leveraging the excess supply of restaurants, and for Airbnb, it was vacant homes,” he suggests. “So, as we enter the recession, there is enough opportunity — hospitals sitting on excess rooms. We have a two to three-year window to rapidly grow that part of the business.” Despite the encouraging signs of growth, HD’s fundraising was off to a rough start. As the pandemic swept across the world, investors turned to telemedicine startups as the default healthcare solution. Ho disagrees with the presumption. “Telehealth works well in the Western market. Basically, you talk to the GP [general physician], you get a prescription, and you go to Walgreens to get your antibiotics, which need a prescription,” he says. “But in Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, you can get that tier of medication at pharmacies [over the counter], removing the need for telehealth.” Investors are now waking up to the potential of HD, which is enabling offline medical providers with digital platforms rather than competing with them. The startup recently closed a $6 million funding round from Partech Partners, M Venture Partners, AC Ventures, iSeed, and Orvel Ventures. It’s also part of a recent batch accepted into Google for Startups Accelerator’s Southeast Asia program. Southeast Asia “omnichannel” health startup Doctor Anywhere gets $88M SGD"
2023-12-18,Apple Watch Series 9 sales to be halted over patent dispute,Hardware,"Update 12/21: Apple has officially halted its online sales of the Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. Apple will be halting sales of its Series 9 smartwatch, TechCrunch has confirmed. The news, shared by 9to5Mac, follows an October ruling by the International Trade Commission (ITC), owing to a patent dispute with California-based med tech firm, Masimo. The dispute stems from the blood sensor monitor on the latest flagship smart Watch. The move goes into effect through the online Apple Store at 3 P.M. this Thursday (December 21), with retail locations ceasing sales December 24 — just ahead of the holiday. The 24th is also the last day for pickup and delivery of online orders. Apple confirmed the move in a statement to TechCrunch this morning: A Presidential Review Period is in progress regarding an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission on a technical intellectual property dispute pertaining to Apple Watch devices containing the Blood Oxygen feature. While the review period will not end until December 25, Apple is preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand. This includes pausing sales of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from Apple.com starting December 21, and from Apple retail locations after December 24. Apple’s teams work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness, and safety features. Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers. Should the order stand, Apple will continue to take all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible. Apple will appeal the ruling, which it believes to be erroneous on the ITC’s part. The company also filed a pair of suits against Masimo in October of last year, alleging its own patent infringement. The company noted at the time, “Masimo has wrongly attempted to use the ITC to keep a potentially lifesaving product from millions of U.S. consumers while making way for their own watch that copies Apple.” Masimo’s own complaint, which was initially focused on technology introduced with the Series 6, dates back to June 2021. The medical company stated that Apple, “began hiring Masimo employees, starting with Masimo’s Chief Medical Officer. In the Fall of 2020, Apple introduced the Series 6, manufactured in Asia.” The primary dispute centers around pulse oximetry, which utilizes an optical sensor to detect blood flow. Last month Masimo received FDA clearance to use its own wrist-worn product for prescription and over-the-counter use."
2022-11-16,Protein programmers get a helping hand from Cradle’s generative AI,Biotech & Health,"Proteins are the molecules that get work done in nature, and there’s a whole industry emerging around successfully modifying and manufacturing them for various uses. But doing so is time consuming and haphazard; Cradle aims to change that with an AI-powered tool that tells scientists what new structures and sequences will make a protein do what they want it to. The company emerged from stealth today with a substantial seed round. AI and proteins have been in the news lately, but largely because of the efforts of research outfits like DeepMind and Baker Lab. Their machine learning models take in easily collected RNA sequence data and predict the structure a protein will take — a step that used to take weeks and expensive special equipment. But as incredible as that capability is in some domains, it’s just the starting point for others. Modifying a protein to be more stable or bind to a certain other molecule involves much more than just understanding its general shape and size. “If you’re a protein engineer, and you want to design a certain property or function into a protein, just knowing what it looks like doesn’t help you. It’s like, if you have a picture of a bridge, that doesn’t tell you whether it’ll fall down or not,” explained Cradle CEO and co-founder Stef van Grieken. “Alphafold takes a sequence and predicts what the protein will look like,” he continued. “We’re the generative brother of that: You pick the properties you want to engineer, and the model will generate sequences you can test in your laboratory.” Predicting what proteins — especially ones new to science — will do in situ is a difficult task for lots of reasons, but in the context of machine learning the biggest issue is that there isn’t enough data available. So Cradle originated much of its own dataset in a wet lab, testing protein after protein and seeing what changes in their sequences seemed to lead to which effects. Interestingly the model itself is not biotech-specific exactly but a derivative of the same “large language models” that have produced text production engines like GPT-3. Van Grieken noted that these models are not limited strictly to language in how they understand and predict data, an interesting “generalization” characteristic that researchers are still exploring. Examples of the Cradle UI in action. Image Credits: Cradle The protein sequences Cradle ingests and predicts are not in any language we know, of course, but they are relatively straightforward linear sequences of text that have associated meanings. “It’s like an alien programming language,” van Grieken said. Protein engineers aren’t helpless, of course, but their work necessarily involves a lot of guessing. One may be fairly certain that among the 100 sequences they’re modifying is the combination that will produce the desired effect, but beyond that it comes down to exhaustive testing. A bit of a hint here could speed things up considerably and avoid a huge amount of fruitless labor. The model works in three basic layers, he explained. First it assesses whether a given sequence is “natural,” i.e.. whether it is a meaningful sequence of amino acids or just random ones. This is akin to a language model just being able to say with 99% confidence that a sentence is in English (or Swedish, in van Grieken’s example), and the words are in the correct order. This it knows from “reading” millions of such sequences determined by lab analysis. Charm Therapeutics applies AI to complex protein interactions, locking down $50M A round Next it looks at the actual or potential meaning in the protein’s alien language. “Imagine we give you a sequence, and this is the temperature at which this sequence will fall apart,” he said. “If you do that for a lot of sequences, you can say not just, ‘this looks natural,’ but ‘this looks like 26 degrees Celsius.’ that helps the model figure out what regions of the protein to focus on.” The model can then suggest sequences to slot in — educated guesses, essentially, but a stronger starting point than scratch. The engineer or lab can then try them and bring that data back to the Cradle platform, where it can be re-ingested and used to fine-tune the model for the situation. The Cradle team on a nice day at their HQ (van Grieken is center). Image Credits: Cradle Modifying proteins for various purposes is useful across biotech, from drug design to biomanufacturing, and the path from vanilla molecule to customized, effective and efficient molecule can be long and expensive. Any way to shorten it will likely be welcomed by, at the very least, the lab techs who have to run hundreds of experiments just to get one good result. Cradle has been operating in stealth and is now emerging having raised $5.5 million in a seed round co-led by Index Ventures and Kindred Capital, with participation from angels John Zimmer, Feike Sijbesma and Emily Leproust. Van Grieken said the funding would allow the team to scale up data collection — the more the better when it comes to machine learning — and work on the product to make it “more self-service.” “Our goal is to reduce the cost and time of getting a bio-based product to market by an order of magnitude,” said van Grieken in the press release, “so that anyone — even ‘two kids in their garage’ — can bring a bio-based product to market.” Generate Biomedicines raises $370M Series B with a focus on protein-based drugs"
2024-04-16,Two Chairs raises $72M Series C in equity and debt to scale its therapist network,Biotech & Health,"When Alex Katz founded Two Chairs in 2017, he firmly believed that in-person therapy is the most effective for behavioral health. Two Chairs used technology — a proprietary matching algorithm — to find the best possible therapists for its clients, but treatments took place primarily inside one of the startup’s half a dozen stylishly designed clinics located in prime locations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. But when COVID-19 erupted and the whole world moved online, the company was forced to reconsider its face-to-face approach. While Two Chairs now operates at least one brick-and-mortar site in each of the three states it serves — California, Washington and Florida — the majority of the company’s more than 500 therapists treat clients virtually. The adoption of the remote-first treatment model has likely helped the company to grow faster (and certainly less expensively) than it would have had it continued to emphasize seeing patients in person. Two Chairs says its revenue expanded eightfold over the last three years. On Tuesday, the company announced a $72 million Series C equity and debt financing round led by Amplo and Fifth Down Capital, bringing Two Chairs’ total funding to $103 million. Amplo also led the company’s $22.5 million Series B in August 2019. The debt portion, which comprised the minority of the latest capital, was provided by Bridge Bank. Two Chairs is one of the latest therapy startups to raise substantial funding rounds. Last week, Grow Therapy, a three-sided mental health platform for therapists, payers and patients, raised an $88 million Series C round led by Sequoia. Katz says that the primary difference between his company and other virtual behavioral health platforms, including Talkspace and Teladoc-owned BetterHelp, is that Two Chairs employs the “vast majority” of its therapists while most competitors contract with their clinicians. “That enables us to select therapists that we think are really high quality, and then we can train them on how to use measurement-based care,” he explained. Clinicians who use measurement-based care (MBC) could improve outcomes and reduce costs by assessing patients’ progress against standard metrics, but only a small portion of therapists use MBC in their practice, according to Katz. Availability of remote therapy from independent clinicians, established institutions and startups like Two Chairs has been helping solve the shortage of mental health professionals in the U.S., but Katz says that online psychotherapy is not the panacea. “While it has gotten easier to find a therapist because of different digital platforms, it’s still just as hard to find the right therapists and really high-quality care, and that’s the problem we’re trying to solve,” he said. “We still have far more demand than we can serve.” Two Chairs will use its new capital to hire more therapists, expand into new states and improve its technology. The company currently offers its services for the price of a co-pay to Aetna and Kaiser Permanente health insurance holders and charges $226 a session for other individuals. As for whether AI could one day replace mental health professionals, and therefore make a business like Two Chairs even more effective, Katz wasn’t so sure it’s going to happen anytime soon. “It is such a human, emotionally driven job, and that’s only possible [to do well] with a great therapist in the room,” he said."
2023-01-10,BioNTech acquires Tunisian-born and UK-based AI startup InstaDeep for £562M,Biotech & Health,"German-based biotech company BioNTech SE is set to acquire InstaDeep, a Tunis-born and U.K.-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup, for up to £562 million (~$680 million) in its largest deal yet. Per Financial Times, the German vaccine maker intends to use InstaDeep’s machine learning to “improve its drug discovery process, including developing personalised treatments tailored to a patient’s cancer.” BioNTech is said to pay £362 million — a mix of cash and an undisclosed amount of BioNTech shares — upfront. The remaining £200 million is dependent on how InstaDeep performs in the future, according to the company’s statement. Last January, InstaDeep, founded by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim in 2014, raised $100 million in Series B financing led by Alpha Intelligence Capital and CDIB. BioNTech was among the participating investors, which also included Chimera Abu Dhabi, Deutsche Bahn’s DB Digital Ventures and Google. The Tunis and London-based enterprise AI startup which uses advanced machine learning techniques to bring AI to applications within an enterprise environment, has offices in Paris, Tunis, Lagos, Dubai and Cape Town. CEO Beguir, in an interview with TechCrunch last year, said InstaDeep uses reinforcement learning, a kind of machine learning that helps design optimization strategies and tackles them simultaneously. Instances where InstaDeep applies its AI tech includes helping a large shipping company to efficiently transport thousands of containers to a railway station or automate scheduling for 10,000 trains. Other examples are the design of advanced therapeutics with silicon and routing components on a printed circuit board. Tunisian enterprise AI startup InstaDeep raises $100M from AI Capital, BioNTech, Google The company is currently working on a moonshot product to automate railway scheduling with Deutsche Bahn, the largest rail operator in Europe. In 2019, InstaDeep formed a multi-year strategic collaboration with BioNTech to launch a joint AI innovation lab where they would deploy the latest advances in AI and ML to develop novel immunotherapies. This acquisition is as a result of this long-term partnership that has seen InstaDeep become the centerpiece of a growing portfolio of initiatives around AI and ML at BioNTech. BioNTech intends to use computational solutions to create personalised drugs for cancer patients and according to its CEO Uğur Şahin, “The acquisition of InstaDeep allows us to incorporate the rapidly evolving AI capabilities of the digital world into our technologies, research, drug discovery, manufacturing and deployment processes. Our aim is to make BioNTech a technology company where AI is seamlessly integrated into all aspects of our work.” InstaDeep’s 240-man team will continue to provide its AI and machine learning services to other companies, including Google and Nvidia, per the company’s statement. “AI is progressing exponentially and our mission at InstaDeep has always been to make sure it benefits everyone. We are very excited to join forces and become one team with BioNTech, with whom we share the same culture of deep tech innovation and focus on positive human impact,” said Beguir on the acquisition. “Together, we envision building a world leader that combines biopharmaceutical research and AI with the aim to design next-generation immunotherapies that enhance medical care — thus, helping fight cancer and other diseases.” The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals."
2024-03-22,Calmara suggests it can detect STIs with photos of genitals — a dangerous idea,AI,"You’ve gone home with a Tinder date, and things are escalating. You don’t really know or trust this guy, and you don’t want to contract an STI, so… what now? A company called Calmara wants you to snap a photo of the guy’s penis, then use its AI to tell you if your partner is “clear” or not. Let’s get something out of the way right off the bat: You should not take a picture of anyone’s genitals and scan it with an AI tool to decide whether or not you should have sex. The premise of Calmara has more red flags than a bad first date, but it gets even worse from there when you consider that the majority of STIs are asymptomatic. So, your partner could very well have an STI, but Calmara would tell you he’s in the clear. That’s why actual STI tests use blood and urine samples to detect infection, as opposed to a visual exam. Other startups are addressing the need for accessible STI testing in a more responsible way. “With lab diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity are two key measures that help us understand the test’s propensity for missing infections and for false positives,” Daphne Chen, founder of TBD Health, told TechCrunch. “There’s always some level of fallibility, even with highly rigorous tests, but test manufacturers like Roche are upfront with their validation rates for a reason — so clinicians can contextualize the results.” In the fine print, Calmara warns that its findings should not be substituted for medical advice. But its marketing suggests otherwise. Before TechCrunch reached out to Calmara, the title of its website read: “Calmara: Your Intimate Bestie for Unprotected Sex” (it’s since been updated to say “Safer Sex” instead.) And in a promo video, it describes itself as “The PERFECT WEBSITE for HOOKING UP!” Co-founder and CEO Mei-Ling Lu told TechCrunch that Calmara was not meant as a serious medical tool. “Calmara is a lifestyle product, not a medical app. It does not involve any medical conditions or discussions within its framework, and no medical doctors are involved with the current Calmara experience. It is a free information service.” “We are updating the communications to better reflect our intentions right now,” Lu added. “The clear idea is to initiate a conversation regarding STI status and testing.” Calmara is part of HeHealth, which was founded in 2019. Calmara and HeHealth use the same AI, which it says is 65-90% accurate. HeHealth is framed as a first step for assessing sexual health; then, the platform helps users connect with partner clinics in their area to schedule an appointment for an actual, comprehensive screening. HeHealth’s approach is more reassuring than Calmara’s, but that’s a low bar — and even then, there’s a giant red flag waving: data privacy. “It’s good to see that they offer an anonymous mode, where you don’t have to link your photos to personally identifiable information,” Valentina Milanova, founder of tampon-based STI screening startup Daye, told TechCrunch. “This, however, doesn’t mean that their service is de-identified or anonymized, as your photos might still be traced back to your email or IP address.” HeHealth and Calmara also claim that they’re compliant with HIPAA, a regulation that protects patient confidentiality, because they use Amazon Web Services. This sounds reassuring, but in its privacy policy, Calmara writes that it shares user information with “service providers and partners who assist in service operation, including data hosting, analytics, marketing, payment processing, and security.” They also don’t specify whether these AI scans are taking place on your device or in the cloud, and if so, how long that data remains in the cloud, and what it’s used for. That’s a bit too vague to reassure users that their intimate photos are safe. These security questions aren’t just concerning for the users — they’re dangerous for the company itself. What happens if a minor uses the website to check for STIs? Then, Calmara ends up in possession of child sexual abuse material. Calmara’s response to this ethical and legal liability is to write in its terms of service that it prohibits minors’ usage, but that defense would hold no legal weight. Calmara represents the danger of over-hyped technology: It seems like a publicity stunt for HeHealth to capitalize on excitement around AI, but in its actual implementation, it just gives users a false sense of security about their sexual health. Those consequences are serious. “Sexual health is a tricky space to innovate within, and I can see where their intentions are noble,” Chen said. “I just think they might be too quick to market with a solution that’s underbaked.”"
2022-10-24,54gene CEO steps down as the company looks to cut more jobs,Biotech & Health,"54gene co-founder and chief executive officer Dr. Abasi Ene-Obong has stepped down from his executive role, the African genomics company confirmed to TechCrunch today. The three-year-old company has appointed General Counsel Teresia L. Bost as interim CEO. She will be supported by Chief Operating Officer Delali Attipoe, the company said. Ene-Obong, on the other hand, will retain his position on 54gene’s board while moving to a new role of senior advisor. Ene-Obong’s resignation and Bost’s ascension comes two months after 54gene laid off 95 employees, or more than 30% of its workforce, in August. The layoffs affected employees, mostly contract staff (in labs and sales departments) recruited to work in 54gene’s COVID business line launched in 2020 to complement its flagship product: a biobank of the African genome. Founded in 2019 by Ene-Obong, 54gene addresses the gap in the global genomics market where Africans make up less than 3% of genetic material used in pharmaceutical research despite being more genetically diverse than any other population. The audacious project has received over $45 million from investors such as Adjuvant Capital, Y Combinator and Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund (CAIF) and partnered with organizations like Illumina, Genentech and Parexel. Biotechs globally tend to have a long-term approach toward making money; in fact, such companies can still be worth billions with little to no revenue. For the Washington-based but Africa-focused 54gene, its primary revenue path involves working with pharmaceutical companies to co-develop drugs and medicine–and that takes time. A typical time frame for a new drug from creation to market entry can take up to a decade, so it made sense for 54gene to turn its lab capabilities to COVID testing as a new source of revenue. African genomics startup 54gene lays off 95 as COVID testing business struggles However, the decline in COVID testing has presented 54gene with fresh challenges: dwindling revenues and redundant roles. Though it has already let go of 95 employees, the company confirmed that it will conduct a second round of layoffs following restructuring across several departments. According to the YC-backed company, it wants to focus resources on its core mission of African genomics research and equalizing precision medicine. At the same time, its clinical diagnostic arm takes the back seat. Here’s more information on the company’s new direction: Going forward, the primary focus will be on the unique genomic research the company has started by further leveraging its genomic datasets derived from 54gene’s state-of-the-art biobank, that currently houses over 130,000 unique patient samples and corresponding genomic data, all with the objective of positioning the company to make contributions to precision medicine and drug discovery. This continues the meaningful work the company has invested in, whilst de-emphasizing the clinical diagnostic business line at the time. It’s unclear exactly why Ene-Obong is stepping down. Yet, it’s not farfetched to assume that the company’s recent struggles are a contributing factor. Interestingly, the former CEO’s resignation also comes one month after Ogochukwu Francis Osifo, the company’s co-founder and VP, Engineering, left the company in September. In response to whether the company’s decision to let him go was performance-related or because the ex-CEO was moving on to new projects, 54gene only said, “Abasi has decided to step down as the CEO but will continue to support the company in its go-forward plans such as strategic partnerships and fundraising. We cannot comment on what other new interests he will pursue if any, but we wish him well and still consider him a key team member.”. As 54gene shifts into a new phase, Ene-Obong, who consulted for organizations such as Gilead and IMS Health in the past, believes the startup is in the best hands as Bost and Attipoe “have deep insight into the workings of 54gene.” Bost boasts more than 20 years of extensive knowledge and experience across pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries with companies such as Celgene and Quartet Health while providing strategic support of securities matters, corporate governance and finance matters. Attipoe, on the other hand, brings more than 15 years of experience in the pharmaceutical sector working with firms like Roche and Genentech. Ene-Obong, addressing his exit and the transition in a statement, said: I have always believed that the scale of genetic diversity in Africa and other highly diverse populations will materially impact our understanding of biology and lead to better medicines and interventions for the global population, and I am proud of what has been achieved at 54gene. I’d like to thank the 54gene Board for their support over the years, and the many talented scientists and technology professionals I have had the pleasure to work with during my time at the company. I will continue to support the company and the scientific ecosystem, particularly the African genomics ecosystem. Teresia and Delali bring decades of experience in building and scaling high-impact global pharma companies, and they also have deep insight into the workings of 54gene. I am excited to see them take the company to its next phase. African genomics startup 54gene raises $25M to expand precision medicine capabilities African genomics startup 54gene raises $15M led by Adjuvant Capital Correction: We have removed the allegations surrounding the departure of the former CEO, for which we have no proof, and sincerely apologise for the error."
2022-01-17,"Inflow, a science-based app for ADHD, raises $2.3M Seed led by Hoxton Ventures",Biotech & Health,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms can include anxiety, chronic boredom, impulsiveness, trouble concentrating, controlling anger, and even depression. But ADHD sufferers can face lengthy waiting periods for assessment and prohibitively expensive treatments. Now a startup, which launched in 2020, hopes to address this by pouring the knowledge of a team of clinicians and coaches into an app with a guided program to address ADHD symptoms. To help, Inflow claims to enable users to implement Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) coping strategies into their daily lives. In 2020 Inflow raised $680K from Rhythm VC and angel investors. It’s now raised $2.3M in seed funding in a round led by London-based Hoxton Ventures. A former grade of Y Combinator 21’s batch, Inflow also drew in participation from US-based Route 66 Ventures. Several prominent angel investors are also backing the company, including the founders of addiction digital clinic Quit Genius (Yusuf Sherwani, Maroof Ahmed, Sarim Siddiqui), and the CEO of legal services chatbot DoNotPay, Joshua Browder. However, it must be pointed out that the app has yet to go through any independent clinical trial, although the company says this is in the pipeline later this year. A spokesman said: “In preparation for a clinical trial we’ve done a usability and feasibility study with the University of Richmond in the US with Dr. Laura Knouse. It did a pre and post symptom and impairment assessment which has been submitted to the journal of attention disorders.” Founded in 2020 by Seb Isaacs, Levi Epstein (formerly Product Manager at Babylon Health), and ADHD expert Dr. George Sachs, Inflow will use the funding to expand its team and roll out additional tools and services. Inflow app Inflow competes in an ADHD app market populated by the likes of apps like SimpleMind Pro, Brain Focus and Focus@Will, but, in truth, most apps are simply touted as productivity apps that might be adapted for use by those with ADHD. How Inflow works is that users complete short daily exercises and challenges to develop healthy habits, learn skills, practice ADHD-specific mindfulness techniques, learn about their neurological differences, and reframe negative thoughts, says the company. Inflow claims it is being downloaded over 15k times every month. Co-founder Seb Isaacs said: “We knew we could simplify the ADHD care process and reach millions of underserved people living with ADHD. Inflow can offer immediate, affordable, and on-demand support in ways our burdened mental health system simply cannot. There’s no waitlist, no need for a referral, no complicated intake process.” Hussein Kanji, Partner at Hoxton Ventures, added: “It’s been a privilege to watch Inflow deliver on its mission to see every person with ADHD thrive.”"
2024-01-11,Whispp brings electronic larynx voice boxes into this millennium,Biotech & Health,"Having a voice is important — figuratively and literally — and not being able to speak is a major impediment to communication. Whispp is working to change the game for individuals with speech disorders and voice disabilities, bringing voice boxes into the current millennium with its groundbreaking AI-powered assistive speech and phone-calling app. At CES 2024, the company launched its newest phone-calling feature that converts whispered and vocal cord-impaired speech into a user’s natural voice in real time. “Voice disabilities and speech disorders like stuttering significantly impact a person’s life and happiness,” said Whispp co-founder and CEO Joris Castermans. “Our solution aims to empower individuals in their daily lives and work. We’re not just transforming voices; we’re advancing communication by making it accessible to all and enhancing quality of life.” Unlike traditional voice conversion technologies, Whispp’s app uses AI to convert voiceless speech into natural and voiced speech in real time. This technology is scalable due to its language-independent nature — and perhaps most intriguingly, users can also recreate their unique voice by providing recordings of their past or current healthy voice, adding a personalized touch to their communication. Whispp is a game changer, accommodating a broad spectrum of voice types — from whispers to rough speech resulting from total laryngectomy after throat cancer. The app is particularly effective for several disorders where deliberately steering the voice toward whispering is beneficial due to neurological changes in the speech system. Castermans stutters himself and discovered that his stuttering is significantly reduced when whispering. The company says research shows that people who stutter severely can reduce their stuttering frequency by an average of 85% while whispering. It also transpires that those suffering from spasmodic dysphonia or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis speak much more relaxed and fluently when they whisper. Unlike conventional speech-to-text approaches with noticeable latency and uneven conversational flow, Whispp’s real-time speech conversion eliminates barriers to natural communication. The company produced a video, which… I mean, just watch it. It’s 90 seconds. You can afford to shed some tears today: “We’ve been researching this for five years, and our product launch today marks a huge milestone. Today’s product launch is for phone call functionality. You can download our iOS or Android app from the app stores, and try it out yourself,” Akash Raj, CTO at Whispp, shares in an interview with TechCrunch at CES. “We have a subscription-based model. Currently, we have 50% early-bird sale, putting the cost at $9.99 per month.” In 2023, Whispp introduced asynchronous message texts, enhancing overall communication by allowing messages to be exchanged at the recipient’s pace, adding flexibility and convenience to the platform. Now, with its new product features, Whispp can accommodate an even more diverse range of voice types and conditions. Even in noisy environments, Whispp enables clear communication and the ability to maintain one’s clarity of speech regardless of external disturbances. I once spoke at a wedding on behalf of my best friend’s father. Not long before the wedding, his dad had a laryngectomy. It was a powerful and beautiful thing, speaking for someone else in such an emotional moment — but as I’m writing this, I’m finding myself wishing this technology had been available then, so he could have spoken to his son and new daughter-in-law in his own voice. Whispp is a whisper of fresh air at CES this year — I love a good tech solution to a real human problem. It is truly a beacon of hope for individuals with speech disorders and voice disabilities and a testament to the transformative power of technology."
2024-01-08,Health in Her HUE closes $3 million seed round,Venture,"Health in Her HUE, a digital health app that focuses on reducing health disparities for women of color, announced that it raised a $3 million seed round today, led by Seae Ventures. The company was founded in 2018 by Ashlee Wisdom. Health in Her HUE seeks to connect women of color with healthcare providers and content that can better address their needs. The company is being built during a precarious time for women’s health, where women of color, especially Black women, still face medical discrimination. Modern medicine is permeated with myths like Black people feel less pain compared to white patients or that Black skin is thicker than white skin. The medical mistreatment many Black people have faced because of such myths has contributed to a wider distrust of medical systems. “Health in Her HUE is uniquely positioned to address the existing racial health disparities and connect our members with providers who are committed to hearing and understanding their unique lived experiences while providing quality care accordingly,” Wisdom told TechCrunch. Image Credits: Courtesy of Health in Her HUE Health in Her HUE says it has nearly 13,000 members, with 1,300 health providers across 60 specialties, from therapy to chiropractic. It also offers educational health content and community forms for women to engage with each other. Wisdom, who remains CEO, says the company will use its seed round to expand its products and programs. That will include an expansion of its current Care Squad program, which provides culturally tailored health education classes, and adding new topics to its platform, including fertility, endometriosis and postpartum recovery. It will also launch a product to answer health questions via video from clinical experts. Wisdom said fundraising for this seed round was “undeniably challenging.” Health in Her HUE technically started raising late in 2022, though it was last year’s market retraction that Wisdom said felt like a “series of unfortunate events.” “I had to maintain a dual focus on both fundraising and revenue, recognizing that the business had to thrive, irrespective of the round’s outcome,” Wisdom said. She met Seae Ventures in her early founder days before she even worked at her own company full-time. The firm was impressed with the company and has been involved with it since it first raised a pre-seed round in 2021. Others that participated in this seed round include Johnson & Johnson Impact Ventures, HBCU Founders Fund, Stanford Impact Fund and Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Labs. To date, Health in Her HUE has raised $4.2 million in funding. The company is now part of the booming digital healthcare market, with a focus that has only become even more pressing given the increased politicization of women’s healthcare. Similar health companies that focus on minority women include Meet Mae and Culture Care. Next, Wisdom hopes to broaden the company’s impact by expanding its reach and attracting new users to the platform. She hopes to also enhance the company’s membership experience to help with customer retention. “I want to ensure that more women of color and individuals can benefit from the valuable offerings we provide,” she said. This piece was updated to reflect the name of the Care Squad Program and correct who founded the company in 2018."
2023-03-09,‘Pan-variant’ COVID vaccine could defang future strains thanks to machine learning,Biotech & Health,"A new approach to vaccines with a machine learning twist could put an end to boosters and seasonal variant shots, according to MIT researchers. This “pan-variant” vaccine would ignore the virus itself but quickly control infections by cracking down on infected cells. To be quite clear, this is still in animal testing and is nowhere near being deployed. But with COVID becoming a resident virus in the human population, longer-lasting solutions than occasional boosters for particularly bad strains are in demand. The problem is that, as amazing as the mRNA vaccines are, they are reactive, not proactive: you see a variant, you sample its spike protein or some other distinctive feature and you slip it into the immune system so it knows to be on the lookout. It’s a bit like letting a rescue dog sniff the belongings of a lost hiker. Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory wanted to find another, more enduring way to keep the body safe from COVID attack. A paper describing their findings was published today in the journal Frontiers in Immunology. The team decided to punt on the idea of attacking the virus itself, because its most distinctive feature, the spike protein, is always changing. Instead, they focused on certain molecular signals that reliably appear on the surface of cells infected by the virus. If these could be spotted early and the immune system’s T cells deployed quickly, the infection would be stalled before it reached dangerous or potentially even infectious levels. These surface signals, called human leukocyte antigens, and they present a variety of peptides to T cells, kind of like raising semaphore flags. If everything is in order, it’s the usual combination of familiar peptides and the T cell moves on. If something is wrong, a fragment of the virus may be hoisted up the flagpole, and the T cells open fire. So what does machine learning have to do with all this? There’s a lot of data out there cataloguing the various proteins and amino acid chains found in COVID, and what they turn into once they’ve infiltrated a cell, and how the cells indicate using HLAs that they’re infected. Machine learning algorithms are good at solving optimization problems like this, where lots of noisy data must be sorted through for specific combinations of qualities. In this case they designed algorithms to catalogue the relevant peptides and select about 30 that are present or “conserved” in all versions of the virus, but also are associated with HLAs, and are likely to be used as flags for T cells to see. Transgenic mice given our versions of HLAs and this new vaccine showed a far more voluminous immune response in the short term after infection, and none died of the virus. “This study offers proof in a living system, an actual mouse, that the vaccines we devised using machine learning can afford protection from the COVID virus,” said MIT PhD student Brandon Carter, one of the paper’s lead authors, in an MIT news article. An interesting possible benefit is that immunocompromised people may get important protection from this approach while the mRNA vaccines don’t work for them. “Long COVID” sufferers too may get some relief in the form of a more comprehensive immune assault on their especially resilient infection. As the study’s abstract puts it: The undetectable specific antibody response in MIT-T-COVID-immunized mice demonstrates specific T cell responses alone can effectively attenuate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest further study is merited for pan-variant T cell vaccines, including for individuals that cannot produce neutralizing antibodies or to help mitigate Long COVID. It’s a promising line of inquiry and a great way to employ advances in computation in service of global health. But it’s also important to recognize it is still early days for the “pan-variant” option. For one thing, it may work with or against existing vaccines — what if the best peptides for the immune response vaccine are the ones targeted for destruction by mRNA priming? The two would be working at cross purposes. And too strong an immune response also runs the risk of collateral damage, mistaken culling of ambiguously signaling cells and the like. But these are the good kind of questions — ones that are relevant because the basic function of the new vaccine appears to work. We’ll know more as the team progresses through more tests of this promising approach."

The current cohort is batch 13, for fall 2022, and we’ve taken a closer look at the five that stood out the most. IndieBio tells us that this batch is going big on diversity, both in terms of gender and geography. The cohort attracted companies from four countries — Brazil, Israel, Turkey and the U.S. are all represented — and 62% of the CEOs in this batch are women. Perhaps predictably, there’s less diversity in the education levels of the IndieBio founders, with 17 Ph.D.s, and all founders hold advanced academic degrees. The companies are extraordinarily health-forward, with nine focusing on the health of the planet and four tackling challenges in human health. They’re approaching the problems from a bunch of different angles, including materials, foods, industrial biotech, therapeutics and diagnostics. In a post-pandemic world, the accelerator has seen some changes to its program, too. Before 2020, all companies were expected to travel to San Francisco for four months, but those days are gone. Today, the 13 cohort companies are part of a hybrid program. “It’s more than just the money,” managing director Po Bronson said in an email to TechCrunch, highlighting the accelerator’s “smart money” chops, “although the fact that we doubled our investment offering to $525,000 doesn’t hurt.” Let’s take a look at the five most interesting companies in this IndieBio cohort — and what we love about ’em. West~bourne — Zero-waste packaged food brand Image Credits: West~bourne Picked by: Haje What they do: West~bourne started out as a zero-waste restaurant in New York. The founder, Camilla Marcus, went on to create a zero-waste consumer packaged goods (CPG) brand. The new company is sourcing all of its ingredients from regenerative agriculture, which is a philosophy that aims to create sustainable food production, as opposed to what a lot of industrial agriculture finds itself doing. The company creates baking mixes, sauces and snacks. Why we like it: Adding organic ingredients to old recipes and calling it a day is so common that you can swing a garden hose in any direction and find 15 brands doing just that. Regenerative ag is a story that’s rare enough to be compelling in a VC context. Of course, the company is entering a fiercely competitive market, and it’s going to be interesting to see if West~bourne can sufficiently break through the wall of marketing noise to find its way to the hearts and minds of its target customers. Other players in this space: There aren’t a lot of CPG brands that have embraced regenerative architecture, but it’s coming. Last year, German company Klim launched a software solution to help farmers transition, and 99 Counties is creating a marketplace for meat farmers using regenerative practices. Cooks Venture, meanwhile, founded by Blue Apron co-founder Matt Wadiak, is trying to make chicken farming greener by relying on regenerative ag to grow cleaner feed. Regenerative agriculture is the next great ally in fight against climate change Gozen Bioworks — a leather alternative Image Credits: Gozen Bioworks Picked by: Haje What they do: Turkey’s Gozen Bioworks is bringing a new type of “leather” to market, which it calls Xylozen. The company describes it as “twice as strong as animal leather, incredibly soft and easy to scale.” The product is meant to replace lambskin, particularly, which is used in high-end applications in the fashion industry, such as bags, coats, gloves, hats and boots. According to her LinkedIn, the company’s founder, Ece Gozen Akin, used to be the sustainability brand ambassador for Nike and is an experienced fashion designer. Why we like it: Leather is often seen as a byproduct of food production, and it’s a common argument that if animals have to die for food, anyway, then why not just use the other parts, too? I do believe in not wasting anything, but I reject the argument that animals have to die for humans to eat, and products like this are a welcome addition to the landscape. Other players in this space: There’s a lot of competition in the alternative leather space, including mycelium (MycoWorks raised $125 million to grow that market segment), and tech hipster favorite Allbirds just announced a plant-based leather alternative as well. Do you claim to care about climate? Let’s talk about what’s on your plate Minus Materials Image Credits: Minus Materials Picked by: Tim What they do: Minus Materials is making concrete using living things. Rather than mining limestone to produce cement, the company is using algae to turn carbon dioxide into limestone, a technique developed by founder and CEO Wil Srubar III, an associate professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. The company estimates that its process can trim up to 60% of the carbon emissions from a typical concrete-making process. Why we like it: The concrete industry has an enormous carbon footprint — to make one pound of concrete, nearly a pound of carbon dioxide is released. Altogether, it’s responsible for at least 8% of the world’s carbon emissions, most of which come from cooking limestone to produce cement. Eliminating that source would go a long way to mitigating climate change. Other players in this space: The way we make cement hasn’t changed much in the last 150 years or so, and myriad companies see room for improvement. One potential competitor, Prometheus Materials, was also started by Srubar. Another is Carbix, also an IndieBio company, as is Maa’va (see below). Others include CarbonCure, Brimstone Energy, Solidia, Blue Planet, Carbicrete and Fortera. Maa’va Image Credits: Maa’va Picked by: Tim What they do: Maa’va replaces the sand used in concrete with plastic waste. The company says that using its aggregate and process to make concrete is cheaper, reduces water use, allows the concrete to cure faster and reduces the end product’s weight by 40%. Why we like it: Concrete production isn’t just a massive source of carbon pollution, it also consumes a massive amount of sand — over 3 billion metric tons per year — much of which is drawn from rivers, streams and shorelines. Replacing sand doesn’t directly diminish the climate impact of concrete, but it does reduce pressure on carbon-sequestering, biodiversity-enhancing ecosystems around the world. Other players in this space: Same as Minus Materials (see above). Mirá Image Credits: Mirá Picked by: Tim What they do: If you’ve ever bought something from Ikea, you’re familiar with MDF (medium-density fiberboard). Furniture companies and builders like it because it’s cheap, smooth, uniform and stable. Typically, MDF is made by compressing wood fibers with a resin binder that essentially glues the fibers together. Mirá, though, uses an enzyme that causes the lignocellulose in the fibers to bond together at the molecular level, eliminating the need for a resin binder. The result, the company said, is more resistant to moisture and more readily recyclable and biodegradable. Why we like it: Most binders are synthetic and contain formaldehyde, which off-gasses when MDF is new and contributes to poor indoor air quality. Plus, they cost money, and Mira says that it can make MDF with higher margins because it doesn’t have to buy the binder. It’s currently expanding its manufacturing facility in Brazil to produce 5,000 boards per week, and it has its sights set on other engineered woods that are increasingly used throughout the construction industry. Other players in this space: 3RT, based in Australia, uses a proprietary water-based, formaldehyde-free resin and process to produce engineered wood made from waste and pulp that mimics boards from whole wood. Massachusetts-based Forust has developed a way to 3D print engineered wood that’s bound using a bio-based resin."
2022-10-27,YouTube opens up certification program for health-related channels,Biotech & Health,"YouTube announced today that it will certify channels of licensed health professionals like doctors, nurses or therapists who produce health-related content. Last year, the company introduced a label noting that the info on the channel is from a certified healthcare professional. Plus, it showed videos from these approved channels in a new carousel called “From health sources” that shows up atop search results. While these features were available to select institutions like educational institutions, public health departments, hospitals and government entities at launch, the company is now expanding the program and inviting U.S.-based health creators to apply for this program. Image Credits: YouTube YouTube follows guidelines set by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies, the National Academy of Medicine and the World Health Organization to build a framework around credible sources for health-related content on the platform. All institutions and health-related creators need to follow these rules while making videos on YouTube. The streaming platform has set a bunch of requirements for creators applying for this certification: they should primarily have health content on the channel; they must have more than 2,000 watch hours of public videos in the last 12 months; and they must attest that they are a licensed doctor, nurse or mental health professional. YouTube will review the channel against its guidelines and it will also check with authorities to verify that applicants have a valid medical license. Once the channels are approved, they will get a special label noting them as “a licensed healthcare professional” resource, and their videos will also surface on health content shelves on top of related search results. YouTube said that this covers search results in most conditions apart from rare diseases (it didn’t specify which ones). The caveat is that if a creator makes a video that’s not directly related to healthcare, the channel still retains the label and the video might also show up on the health content shelf if the creator uses keywords related to a medical condition. In a call with TechCrunch, Dr. Garth Graham, global head of YouTube Health, said that the onus of making health-related videos lies on the creator. However, the company doesn’t provide any toggle if they want to demark an unrelated video. Notably, YouTube launched a program last month that surfaces personal stories from patients or their relatives in a separate panel when users search for ailments like cancer, and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. But there is a chance that a health creator’s personal story might show up in the health resources panel rather than the personal stories panel. Image Credits: YouTube There is also a concern about certified health-related channels spreading misinformation. Dr. Graham insisted that the company uses a combination of processes (AI) and people (reviewers) to measure them against YouTube’s guidelines. “If a channel that is eligible for these features receives a Community Guidelines strike or has content removed for violating our policies, they will lose their eligibility. Channels can reapply in 90 days if the Community Guidelines issues have been resolved. This is similar to how our YouTube Partner Program works, which many creators are familiar with,” he said. The company also reviews these channels annually to ensure that it is following YouTube’s rules for health-related content and removes them from the program if necessary. Apart from the U.S., YouTube is also opening up the application process for healthcare institutions and individuals in Germany. Users in that region will start seeing healthcare certification labels and the health content carousel early next year once the first set of channels is approved."
2023-11-06,Daye now offers tampon-based STI screening — starting in the UK,Biotech & Health,"U.K. femcare-turned-gynaecological-health startup, Daye, has expanded its tampon-based home screening service to add STI testing. The startup is billing this “non-invasive screening” service for sexually transmitted infections as a “world first”. The “STI Diagnostic Tampon” service uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing tech to detect the presence of pathogens. Daye is launching with the ability to test for five STIs — namely: Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomonas, mycoplasma and ureaplasma — which were selected because they are the most common STIs. But more tests are planned. The move comes a year after the startup took the wraps off an ambitious push into gynaecological health — with the launch of a vaginal microbiome screening service. Daye tells TechCrunch it’s had “thousands” of customers for that service — which is a little more complicated to engage with as samples need to be sent back along with an ice pack (and hopefully minimal postal delays) in order that the lab can detect live pathogens. The STI test is simpler as the PCR test is looking for genetic material — dead or alive; this type of test doesn’t distinguish — so the user just needs to pop their sample in the extraction solution provided before they post it off for analysis. Daye sells tampons for regular, menstrual use too, of course. But it’s always been interested in doing more with the staple female hygiene product than just catching flow. Its signature product is a CBD-infused tampon for combating period cramps. Though it also sells a “nude” version (i.e. no CBD) — and that core offering is the basis for a growing range of vaginal- and sexual-health-screening services which repurpose the basic tampon as a novel sample collecting device. The clever twist here is it makes what could be an intrusive test into something its customers are likely to be intimately familiar with — and literally as easy as inserting and removing a tampon. Daye didn’t invent the idea of using tampons to test for STIs, as founder Valentina Milanova explained when we dug into its wider mission last year. U.K. university researchers pioneered menstrual tampon screening back in the 1990s. But Milanova is on a mission to expand the technique’s use and utility — seeing it as a convenient way to help women learn a heck of a lot more about their own bodies from the comfort of their own bathrooms. The startup also claims tampons make a better testing device than the swabs or other protocols a patient might be administered at a sexual health clinic or doctor’s office since its test tampons collect more vaginal fluid and cover a larger surface area — so it contends this is both a more accurate way to STI test than a swab and more comfortable than a speculum. PCR testing, meanwhile, has gotten very familiar after the COVID-19 pandemic. Daye’s STI test uses the same principle as this gold standard detection test for coronavirus — but in this case it’s looking for trace (or more) amounts of genetic material from pathogens that cause STIs. “The specificity of PCRs ensures that false-positive results are reduced, providing a more reliable diagnosis,” it suggests, also noting the test can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single sample. So full marks for convenience. More convenience is coming, too, as it adds more tests, too: Daye says HPV is next on its list — an STI which has been linked to increased cervical cancer risk. Another on its list to add “soon” is to offer GBS screening for pregnant patients. “GBS is a common bacteria often carried in the intestines or lower genital tract. While usually harmless in adults, it can cause severe infections in newborns if transmitted during delivery. Testing pregnant women for GBS allows for the timely administration of antibiotics during labour, significantly reducing the risk of neonatal infections,” Daye tells us. The startup also plans to offer herpes screening for everyone down the line. The STI testing service is being launched in the U.K. first — at a cost of £99 a pop — with the US slated to get the service “soon”. Daye is also aiming to expand screening services elsewhere in Europe, saying it’s currently working on building out an aftercare offering to support patients across the EU. How does the STI testing service work? The user receives a test kit in the post and, after self administering a vaginal swab by inserting and removing the test tampon and then preserving their sample as instructed, they post it sample back to Daye’s partner lab for analysis — getting results digitally, via Daye’s app, in a few days. For a further £29 they can also get a “comprehensive” consultation about their results with a nurse. Users who don’t purchase this optional extra, but do test positive for an STI, will receive a free five minute call to walk them through their results and advise on next steps, per Daye. One question we had is related to how sexual health clinics may routinely test for HIV when a patient attends — i.e. even if they’re at the clinic for another sexual health worry. So if more people choose to adopt at-home testing for STIs, thanks to Daye’s convenient alternative, they may be missing out on the chance to acquire important health info — since clinics or doctor’s offices can often nudge an attending patient to take the opportunity to test more widely while they’re there in person. Asked how it’s mitigating this risk, Daye told us: “We enable our patients to book in-clinic appointments for HIV screening, and in the future, we may also expand to at-home blood testing for HIV. We ensure that our patients are well-educated on the risks associated with HIV and are reminded of the need for regular testing. We’d like to play a meaningful role in destigmatising sexual health and provide medically-backed advice on the recommended cadence of screening.” The startup also gave us a breakdown of the main customers for its novel vaginal microbiome screening service a year+ on from that launch — saying there are three main groups: people with recurrent vaginal symptoms and discharge who want to identify and treat the exact pathogen that’s causing their discomfort to enable more target diagnostics and aftercare; people with persistent unexplained fertility challenges, or those undertaking an IVF cycle, who want to ensure that their vaginal environment is optimal for conception; people with suspected perimenopause and or menopause, who want to confirm the state of the vaginal microbiome and share this information with their doctor to help inform the best HRT pathway for them.

2023-02-22,Future Fields is turning fruit flies into bioreactors,Biotech & Health,"It takes a lot of infrastructure, and money, to build the giant bioreactors experts say are needed to mass produce raw materials to make things like medicine, vaccines and cultivated meat. Matt Anderson-Baron, co-founder and CEO of Canada-based Future Fields, told TechCrunch that 10 billion liters of bioreactor capacity will be needed by 2030, yet only 61 million liters of it exists today. In addition, the recombinant protein, which is the output of the bioreactors, accounts for the majority of the costs associated with producing cultivated meat and is partly why that sector has not been able to reach price parity with traditional meat. Future Fields thinks it has come up with a more cost-effective and sustainable way to do this through its EntoEngine, an approach that uses fruit flies — not giant steel tanks — for recombinant protein production. Future Fields is tackling cultured meat’s biggest problem “Traditionally, growth factors and recombinant proteins are produced in microbial systems grown in big stainless steel tanks, so they’re competing for the same infrastructure,” Anderson-Baron said. “Where we come in is we replace the bioreactor with an insect. We’re genetically engineering them — insects that can be grown in simple plastic containers — and it is very, very scalable, cost-effective and, importantly, circumvents the challenges associated with that infrastructure and frees that supply chain up for the people who actually need it or not, without creating more demand for it.” Anderson-Baron, his wife, Jalene Anderson-Baron, and co-founder Lejjy Gafour have been working on this problem for a while (we last profiled Future Fields in 2020), and today announced $11.2 million in seed extension funding that enables the company to build a production facility to launch its first products outside of cultivated meat: research, cell therapies and biopharmaceuticals, as well as scale its team. Joining Bee Partners in the round are Toyota Ventures, Builders VC, AgFunder, Amplify Capital, Milad Alucozai of BoxOne Ventures, Green Circle Foodtech, Siddhi Capital and Climate Capital. Anderson-Baron declined to disclose growth metrics, but did say the company’s team has doubled in size over the last year, and it has shipped its animal protein product to more than 60 companies in the last year-and-a-half. Future Fields is building its first production facility next to its corporate headquarters in Edmonton, Canada, and, once completed, will enable the production of recombinant proteins at kilogram scale with just 10,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Meanwhile, its EntoEngine technology provides a suite of human recombinant protein products for medical research and biopharmaceuticals, including five proteins that aid in wound healing, reproductive biology, muscle and breast milk development and stem cell research. Anderson-Baron said using the flies enables both speed and scalability. EntoEngine’s fruit fly technology can create biomass anywhere from 16 to 30 times faster than traditional bioreactors and is able to generate proteins every day with the same footprint and same infrastructure. “That’s not possible with these other systems where you have designated bioreactors that are in operation often for weeks at a time to do one single manufacturing run,” he added. “It gives us a lot more flexibility, and importantly, we can scale up much quicker and more cost-effectively because we’re replacing the stainless steel tanks that need to be plugged into the wall with an insect.” Got a news tip or inside information about a topic we covered?

2022-11-14,Google’s Health Connect app is now available in beta,Apps,"Google announced today that its Health Connect app is now available in beta on the Play Store. Health Connect is designed to centralize access to health and fitness data from various eligible apps. Today, more than 10 health and fitness apps are launching integrations with Health Connect, including MyFitnessPal, Oura and Peloton. The app syncs health and fitness data from eligible platforms and allows other apps to gain access to this data with their consent, while providing centralized privacy controls for users. Developers have previously had to establish multiple API connections to share data between different apps, which limited developers’ data sharing capabilities and made it hard for users to unlock this data for use in different apps. With Health Connect, developers no longer have to build a whole new integration. Google says building an integration with a new app is as simple as reading in new data from Health Connect. “For example, Android users will now be able to sync and get credit for their Peloton workouts in apps like Oura, MyFitnessPal, WeightWatchers and Lifesum,” Google said in a blog post. “Now, through a single integration with Health Connect, Peloton Members will have the option to share their workout stats across the ecosystem of apps they use to support their overall wellness.” Image Credits: Google Google says Health Connect provides a standardized data schema that supports 40+ data types across six categories. The schema covers a wide range of use cases, from exercises to sleep tracking to vital signs. The app not only simplifies app connectivity, but also give users more privacy controls by allowing them to monitor which apps have access to data. In the past, users have had to navigate to multiple apps to manage data permissions and developers had to build out permissions management UIs themselves. Health Connect allows users to manage permissions in a single place. As for developers, Health Connect provides the permissions management hub and granular permissions UIs out of the box. Google collaborated with Samsung to build Health Connect with the goal of simplifying the connectivity between health and fitness apps. The company first unveiled the initiative earlier this year at its I/O developer conference. Health Connect is available to download as a public beta via the Google Play Store starting today. Google hasn’t detailed its plans regarding a full public release. At launch, the app has integrations with Fitbit, Samsung Health, Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, Oura, WeightWatchers, Flo, Lifesum, Signos, Tonal, Outdooractive and Proov Insight. Google and Samsung team up to make sharing data between health and fitness apps easier"
2023-11-22,"Cameroonian healthtech Waspito gets $2.5M seed extension to scale, tap offline patients",Biotech & Health,"Cameroonian health startup Waspito has secured a $2.5 million seed extension from DP World through Newtown Partners, Saviu Ventures, AAIC Investment, Axian Ventures and CFAO’s Health54 to spur its growth in the Francophone region. Waspito is a health-focused social network that allows users (patients) to access and consult with verified doctors over video calls. Additionally, it facilitates sample collection from homes and the delivery of medication. The startup branched out into Ivory Coast at the start of the year, where it is also piloting a hybrid model, and has its eyes on Senegal and Gabon, backed by a new round after last year’s $2.7 million seed. Jean Lobe Lobe founded Waspito at the start of 2020, just before the COVID pandemic became a global health emergency, a timely period for the health startup to kickstart its mission of making healthcare accessible to all. However, Waspito sought to approach telemedicine differently. Instead of building a platform that would involve pre-registration and booking of consultation meetings, Lobe opted for one where users could instantly connect with doctors. “Going online to book an appointment for later doesn’t really ring a bell when somebody is really seriously sick or someone that needs a doctor right away. This is why we do instant video consultations,” Lobe told TechCrunch. When a user logs in to the site, which Lobe refers to as Facebook for healthcare, they are allowed to select a doctor from a list of those that are currently online. And, where a doctor recommends medical tests, a technician from one of its partner laboratories is sent for sample collection. Waspito has integrated with some local hospitals for support with patients requiring deeper reviews and/or admission. “We have partnered with hospitals in a way that after consultation on Waspito, care continues in the nearest hospital without the need for additional consultation payments or registration. We have connected with all these stakeholders because, overall, we want to connect the healthcare ecosystem online and be a one-stop shop for all healthcare services,” said Lobe. Kenya’s MyDawa aims to be an all-in-one health platform backed by $20 million funding Patients make payments through various options, including insurance, before consultations, which Lobe says incentivizes doctors to remain online for the extra earnings. Users also get to anonymously join various disease support groups for tailored advice. Lobe is convinced that constantly having doctors online is one of the ways of making them accessible to patients domiciled in target countries, where the latest data shows there are fewer than two doctors for every 10,000 people. The startup, declared best health startup in Africa during this year’s VivaTech awards, claims to have so far reached 650,000 users in Cameroon and Ivory Coast, has on-boarded 950 doctors and facilitated 60,000 consultations. Waspito anticipates that the number of consultations done via its platform will grow as it rolls out a hybrid model it is piloting in Ivory Coast — where it has set-up mini-clinics to reach offline patients. The startup is establishing these clinics within the branch network of La Poste Corporation, the national postal service in Ivory Coast, which has a wide coverage across the country. With the help of nurses manning these sites, patients will be able to connect with doctors virtually and access other healthcare services by its partners. This is a necessary strategy for Waspito as a majority of users in Africa remain offline, due to the cost of internet and smartphones, even as Africa’s digital economy continues to expand. It is set to introduce the hybrid approach in Cameroon and Senegal at the end of the first quarter next year. Fundraising advisory firm Raisers was Waspito’s adviser during the round. “Healthcare is actually for everybody and that means we have to reach out to everybody. These mini-clinics, we think, are the best way to connect with the underserved populations,” said Lobe. African health tech startups in the supply chain segment show rapid growth, spurring a $7M investment initiative"
2020-06-10,"Cue Health raises $100 million to speed development of rapid, portable COVID-19 diagnostics",Biotech & Health,"San Diego-based startup Cue Health has closed a $100 million Series C funding round, including participation from Decheng Capital, Foresite Capital, Madrone Capital Partners, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, ACME Capital and others. The funding will be used to help Cue finish up development, validate and scale production of its Cue Health Monitoring System and test cartridges, including test kits designed to diagnose COVID-19, which are currently being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization. Cue has been developing its connected, portable lab to provide on-site care, including molecular diagnostic tests since its founding a decade ago. The company also secured a $13 million contract in March specifically targeted toward development of a portable point-of-care COVID-19 test. Cue co-founder and CEO Ayub Khattak says that this pandemic has only re-emphasized the need for its product, which is primarily aimed at providing rapid, simple-to-use diagnostics that can be implemented quickly by a wide range of front-line workers in a variety of settings. Concurrently with its EUA process for the Cue COVID-19 test, the company is also finishing up validation of the results for its influenza A and B tests, which will be used to submit to the agency for final approval of those tests as well. Its tests would provide at-home molecular-based testing, with a connected results platform that can immediately provide diagnostics to certified healthcare providers within 20 minutes, unlocking a new level of remote care. In total, Cue has $30 million in contracts from the U.S. HHS’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) across its efforts both for flu testing and for COVID-19 diagnostics."
2024-05-30,Rhea reaps $10M more led by Thiel,Biotech & Health,"Fertility remains a pressing concern around the world — birthrates are down in many countries, and infertility rates (that is, the inability to conceive) are up. Rhea, a Singapore- and New York-based reproductive health service provider, aims to tackle this challenge by bridging the global value chain and using technology. Rhea said Thursday that it has secured $10 million in funding to continue expanding its service. Previous backer Thiel Capital led this latest infusion, with participation from LifeX Ventures, Blue Lion Global and FJ Labs. With the new money, Rhea plans to acquire more clinics in 2024, broaden its services in new markets, and grow its team of reproductive health professionals to establish a high-quality standard of fertility care across the globe. Rhea now has more than 380 staff across 12 markets. The latest funding came on the back of its initial $20 million in 2023 and an acquisition of Embryonics, an Israel-based startup that has built AI-based IVF software solutions, earlier this year. The startup also announced today its launch of Rhea, which is an end-to-end reproductive health service that connects prospective families in Asia with complementary operations in North America and Europe. Rhea’s ecosystem is comprised of GenPrime, a global network of owned and partner clinics; Rhea Labs, an integrated technology platform that uses data to speed up time to market and incorporate quality product feedback to enhance patient outcomes; and a suite of fertility wellness partners, including Moom Health, Elix Healing and Madam Partum, to offer more comprehensive reproductive health services. Rhea has integrated Embryonics‘ AI-driven diagnostic tools into its product development pipeline and exclusive regional distribution rights with leading medical partners. Rhea Labs is also developing RheaX, a global gamete exchange company that develops creative solutions to improve the process of matching and transferring gametes. A partnership with Baylor College of Medicine, a health sciences university in the Texas Medical Center will help develop the exchange. Rhea was initially incubated by Recharge Capital in response to the growing trend of women and families globally desiring more flexibility and options in family planning, CEO of Rhea Margaret Wang told TechCrunch. Lorin Gu, the founding partner of Recharge Capital, founded Rhea, and Wang, who joined Recharge first as an advisor in January 2023, took over Rhea as CEO in September. GenPrime was originally planned to consist of a small roll-up of Southeast Asia-based clinics. However, the firm’s members, based on their own experiences with fertility, wanted to build a company that would provide not just the clinical network (GenPrime) but also medical devices, insights and a comprehensive set of wellness services on the platform. “The traditional approach is one that’s highly siloed and relies on third-party players — we’re innovating around integration to link different parts of the value chain together and combining not just an elevated physical clinic experience but the application of technology along the way,” Wang said. The world’s lowest birth rates in Asia A recent report shows that global birth rates have decreased by half in the last 70 years, with more than half of countries below the replacement rate. (Some quick stats: South Korea has the world’s lowest birth rate, Singapore fell below 1.0 last year and China, the largest market in the region, saw its population decline for the second consecutive year.) “Rapidly declining fertility rates around the world are a signal of a looming population decrease, the effects of which are particularly impacting countries in Asia,” Wang said. In addition, each country has its own regulations, making it challenging to navigate the fertility journey with unique requirements. For example, China’s National Health Commission prohibits single women from using assisted reproductive technology (ART), including egg freezing. The services are only available to married heterosexual couples in China. As a result, numerous Chinese patients need to journey across the Asia region to receive fertility services, Wang noted. In Singapore, elective egg freezing for women aged 21 to 37 was only legalized in July 2023. Rhea’s platform connects prospective families in Asia dealing with diverse regulatory challenges related to reproductive health. Despite the abundance of new options available, researching, gathering information and making informed decisions remains a daunting challenge due to the emotional and vulnerable nature of the experience, Wang explained. “On the clinic network side, we look to players like CCRM and Spring Fertility with their similar patient-first focus and, of course, IVI RMA and EuginGroup for the scale,” Wang said when asked about its industry peers. “But these all are generally throughout Europe and the United States. In Asia, the groups are much smaller and either within single countries (which carry single-country risk) or across the microregion. But none are thinking about the end-to-end ecosystem, global first and the way in which we develop and integrate technology and devices. Rhea remains differentiated as it is the first integrated ecosystem for intended families centered in Asia.” The outfit is currently in the growth phase, building on the assets it acquired last year and expanding its integrated model to reach wider customers. As an example, Rhea acquired a medical tourism company specializing in outbound demand from China for fertility services. “This company normally refers patients to partner clinics, but by joining our company, we can now direct demand to clinics we own, know and trust the quality of experience. The overall business margins improve because now we’re not just capturing parts of the experience (lead generation referral or individual services) but rather that whole patient journey,” Wang said. The company makes money from its clinic services, generating leads for partner clinics and companies, and holding exclusive distribution or development rights for technology and medical devices. To deliver an integrated ecosystem of service, Rhea introduced its senior advisory group that includes Dr. Milton Leong, a pioneer of IVF in Hong Kong and founding president of The Hong Kong Society for Reproductive Medicine; Cynthia Hudson, VP of clinical strategy at TMRW Life Sciences; Dr. Javaid I.

2023-01-23,"Amazon launches RxPass, a $5/month Prime add-on for all-you-need generic drugs covering 80 conditions",Commerce,"More than two years since announcing Amazon Pharmacy to take some of the prescription drugs business away from big (and smaller) drug stores, Amazon is launching a new product to expand its reach in the space. Today, it’s taking the wraps off RxPass, a service where Prime users in the U.S. can pay a monthly flat fee of $5 to get as many generic versions of medications as they need. Amazon said that initially the service will cover generic drugs for 80 common ailments — they include, for example, Losartan (the generic for the hypertension drug Cozaar) and Sertraline (the generic for antidepressant Zoloft) and hair-growth pills — and it would not comment on its plans to expand the list. The 80 conditions were selected, so to speak, to make it an offer attractive to a wide base of potential customers. Dr. Vin Gupta, the chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, said that more than 150 million people in the U.S. already take one or more of the medications in the RxPass offering. In addition to RxPass (not to be confused with another healthcare service for B2B called RxPass) only being available to U.S. Prime users — one more sweetener for Amazon’s membership tier that started with free shipping but now nets services like entertainment, grocery shopping services, etc. to attract repeat purchasing — RxPass is not open to people on government medical plans like Medicare or Medicaid (Amazon Pharmacy is a provider for these and thus cannot offer it direct). One pays the $5 out of pocket, not on insurance. You sign up for it in your app as a Prime user, under Pharmacy. This is a big and pretty bold move for Amazon; $5/month is the fee regardless of the amount a customer orders, meaning the service is aimed at those who are currently already paying more than this per month for their meds for these 80 conditions, or think that they might over time need to pay more, or are looking for one-stop services with a predictable cost each month. It also competes with a few other things also brewing in the market: namely, Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs effort. Indeed, as with a lot of other services on Amazon’s platform, it’s balanced that promise of convenience carefully against pricing, playing in this case also on a shortcoming in the market and specifically in healthcare. On one hand are the basic predicaments and pitfalls of systems like those in the U.S. that rely on health insurance to operate, and generally are very expensive regardless for users even with those plans, leading many to forego getting what they need. (This is not the only problem with health in the U.S. of course, but a big component of preventative and chronic care.) “Navigating insurance can be a maze and getting to the pharmacy a burden,” Gupta writes. “Sometimes that has led to poor outcomes: new medications don’t get filled, refills don’t get picked up, and patients suffer.” On the other hand are the conveniences and cost benefits of the Prime service being put to work to fill that gap. “Prime members already get fast, free delivery on prescription medications, and RxPass is one more way to save with Amazon Pharmacy. Any customer who pays more than $10 a month for their eligible medications will see their prescription costs drop by 50% or more, plus they save time by skipping a trip to the pharmacy,” said John Love, vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, in a statement. “We are excited to offer our customers surprisingly simple, low pricing on the eligible medications they need each month.” Amazon would not disclose how it arrived at $5 and whether that’s a subsidized figure to attract more users, but data published last year by health policy researchers KFF, citing figures from the OECD, noted that in the U.S. in 2019, annual per-capita out-of-pocket payments for prescribed medicines annually averaged $164. This is not a direct comparison, as this is not a figure that covers 80 conditions, but it is the average, giving an idea of what is spent around the most common conditions that Amazon is also targeting. Its aim also is to net in users for Amazon Pharmacy, which will provide meds for all of the other conditions. The bigger service also provides discounts on generic and non-generic meds (up to 80% and 40% respectively, Amazon says). Amazon has been eyeing up the opportunity to do more in healthcare for many years, buying startups and launching new services and products in aid of that. These have included acquisitions of online pharmacy PillPack in 2018 and primary care tech platform OneMedical for $3.9 billion in 2022. And in addition to the launch of Amazon Pharmacy in 2020, last year it launched a telehealth service called Amazon Clinic. This was the company’s second attempt at telehealth after mothballing Amazon Care (a service for its own employees). The OneMedical deal is still making its way through regulatory approvals, but in the meantime this latest launch of RxPass underscores the company’s intent to keep at this, despite the wider restructuring and 18,000 layoffs at the business that are currently underway."
2023-08-17,HealthXCapital’s team joins Jungle Ventures,Biotech & Health,"The team behind HealthXCapital, which invested in and helped health tech startups scale up, has joined Singapore-based Jungle Ventures. Seemant Jauhari, who led HealthXCapital since it was founded eight years ago, is now a partner at Jungle, where he will invest in healthcare startups in Southeast Asia and India. HealthXCapital’s portfolio includes RED.Health, Homage, Medfin and THB. The firm has fully deployed its first fund and will no longer make any further investments. At Jungle, Jauhari will take a similar approach as he did at HealthXCapital, combining capital with strategic partners in the healthcare sector to help startups toward validation and commercialization. These partners include providers, distributors and IT system integrators. Jauhari noted that about 30% of the global population live in India and Southeast Asia, but the regions are very underserved, with just 4% of the gross domestic product going toward healthcare. That’s where he sees an opportunity for digital healthcare and new business models to increase access to healthcare. Seemant Jauhari. Image Credits: Jungle Ventures As an example of how Jungle has worked with healthcare startups, Jauhari said one of its portfolio companies needed to expand from five to 12 cities. Securing supply from providers was crucial to meet demand, so Jungle’s board partners worked with the startup to create a time-bound group-level plan. Then, based on that plan, it used its strategic network to facilitate crucial partnerships across healthcare providers. Then an operational partner helped the startup run a unit economics optimization initiative that improved margins by almost 20% to 25%. Jauhari added that key trends emerging in Asian health tech include large-scale adoption of digital platforms in markets like India, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam and specialty care growing by taking a “phygital” approach through a combination of brick-and-mortar locations and online platforms. In terms of valuations, Jauhari said it has not been a major concern for the healthcare sector because it has been underfunded, especially at venture growth stages. “Case in point, in the last five years, of the 2,000+ healthcare startups in India and Southeast Asia, less than 10% reached the venture growth stage and less than 20% of the total capital invested in the region has been invested in venture growth,” he said. “Hence, we see a clear opportunity to invest in an undercapitalized stage and region. Combining this with the resilience of the healthcare sector, we believe that sustainable and scalable businesses will drive steady valuations.” It’s never too late to align product-market fit metrics with your company’s values"
2023-01-07,Urine luck: These CES startups want to take a closer look at your waste,Hardware,"You wait for years for a urine analysis company, then all of them hit their flow all at once. One of the notable trends at CES in Las Vegas this year was that the quantified-self movement is going deeper. No longer content with just measuring your heart rate, number of steps and EKG on your wrist, a new generation of startups is inching toward full-on medical-grade analysis of its users. Here are a few to keep an eye on: Withings Withings U-Scan. Image Credits: Withings Health hardware company Withings this week released the U-Scan in Europe and announced it is working with the FDA to secure a U.S. launch as well. The product uses a hands-free system that can take up to three months worth of measurements with a single cartridge. Pee is the magic number, as Withings puts a urine analysis lab in your toilet Olive Once you get over the nervousness of having that many lenses near your junk (don’t worry, there are no actual cameras involved), Olive can get on the go, analyzing your pee as you go. Image Credits: Haje Kamps/TechCrunch Israeli startup Olive recently raised a $10 million round of funding, and promises to use optics only to analyze urine. The company uses a special toilet seat, no strips or additional accessories required. It is initially aiming at care homes and vulnerable populations but is hoping to find a user base across a number of healthcare sectors. Vivoo The Vivoo solution dispenses a strip, then slurps it back in for optical analysis. No touching required. Image Credits: Haje Kamps/TechCrunch Vivoo has been making at-home urine test strips for a long time and it showed off the next iteration of its business with a smart toilet. It’s aimed at residential care, elderly and healthcare markets. It gives a convenient alternative for users who may struggle to perform urine testing with hand-held urine strips. We can only imagine it was feeling a little awkward about its “world first” marketing messaging at its booth. Especially given that the Vivoo booth was right next to Withing’s, where it was showing off how it had beaten the “world first” to market. The product is a prototype, with a broader roll-out in the not-too-distant future. The company raised a $6 million Series A fundraise in June 2021. The round was led by Draper Associates. Special Zone Master Well that’s reassuring. Image Credits: SZM Don’t worry, it wasn’t all urine at CES this year. We also found SZM — Special Zone Master — which promises to do “visual analysis” of your other favorite bodily waste — poop. The company promises to analyze stool shapes and color, record the time and frequency of your bowel movements and detect the presence of blood as well. “Just by taking a closer look at the stool, we can find the first signs of a health problem and take action before it is too late,” the company said in its marketing materials. We were curious to learn more, but the company’s founders where nowhere to be found — presumably, they were taking a well-deserved restroom break. It wasn’t entirely clear how far along the Korean startup was in its journey toward bringing its tech to a toilet seat near you."
2023-06-16,Make way for a new vegan protein on the menu,Biotech & Health,"Fancy some dairy-free protein rich ice cream with a microbial twist? Finnish startup Solar Foods‘ novel alternative protein, Solein, is now on the menu of a restaurant in Singapore where it’s been blended into a custom (vegan) chocolate gelato. It’s the first time the startup’s microbial protein has been available for the general public to tuck into. And, indeed, it’s just one restaurant (Fico) that’s put it on the menu so far. But this is a baby step toward what the startup hopes will blossom into a wide range of food industry partnerships in the coming years as it works towards bringing commercial scale production on stream. Solar Foods gained its debut regulatory clearance to sell Solein in Singapore last September. It has also filed for clearances for human consumption of its novel protein in other markers, including the US and Europe. But last month it announced a strategic alliance with Japan’s Ajinomoto, a food company that will be developing products that use Solein. So Asia is where developments look to be moving fastest so far. As we’ve reported before, the Finns behind Solar Foods are tackling the huge yet under-addressed, elephant-in-the-room problem of how to make humanity’s food system sustainable. Bottom line: If we’re going to avoid climate disaster then cutting emissions generated by farming is critical. And it’s industrial animal farming — for meat and dairy — that is particularly problematic for the environment given how much land and water is required to yield these animal-derived proteins. This is why, in recent years, all sorts of plant-based alternative protein makers have sprung up, seeking to respond to the sustainability challenge by producing high quality vegan faux meats that can still tickle the taste buds of meat-eaters. Solar Foods is a little different vs the average alt protein maker. Firstly it’s not seeking to sell any food direct to consumers itself. Rather It’s aiming to add another string to the bow of vegan food producers since its alternative protein doesn’t involve any agriculture at all. So there’s no photosynthesis attached to these nutrient-dense calories. Zooming out, reduced dependence on land for human food production opens up the prospect of repurposing large amounts of farmland for different uses that fight climate change and combat biodiversity loss, such as rewilding schemes, soils restoration, tree planting and allowing the return of other carbon-capturing natural habitats. Additionally, Solein being neither land nor weather dependent makes it a very reliable source of edible protein — at least provided you have access to (affordable) electricity and a supply of clean water. Hence why the startup touts it as “the world’s most sustainable protein”. (Albeit, the source of electricity involved in Solein’s production may still put some wrinkles in the sustainability picture, unless or until it’s 100% renewable energy powering every Solar Foods bioreactor.) The startup likens the process for producing Solein to brewing or wine making — but with just three ‘ingredients’ needed: Air, water and electricity (plus the aforementioned bioreactor where the fermentation process takes place). The taste of the harvested, dried and powdered protein is described as being mild and neutral. Solar Foods says this makes it suitable for being incorporated into a variety of foodstuffs, both sweet and savoury. In the event, the first publicly available dish is a dessert: The aforementioned vegan gelato that packs a protein punch. The gelato is protein rich because Solein is 65%-70% protein — which makes it considerably richer in protein than milk, the traditional base ingredient for gelato (although some traditional gelato may also use egg yolk). We’ve asked for details of the macronutrient breakdown of the Solein-based gelato and how it stacks up vs traditional gelato. And will add the info if we get it. Per Solar Foods, the macronutrient composition of Solein cells is very similar to that of dried soy or algae. It also provides iron and B vitamins. So its pitch for the novel ingredient is that it’s rich in the types of nutrients humans often source from animal-derived foodstuffs. Solein’s sunny upside, however, is this nutrient dense protein does not come chain-linked to the vast environmental, ethical and even health problems attached to industrial animal farming — whether it’s the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest to plant soya to feed beef cattle; the horror of the average slaughterhouse; or the risk that habitat destruction could lead to more viruses making the zoonotic leap from wild animals to humans as wildlife is forced into increasingly closer proximity with people. Tackling the climate crisis is also of course an absolute economic imperative since the costs of not addressing global warming will be unimaginably greater than if we make the necessary investments to avoid global heating disaster. While the world keeps breaking temperature records, the good news is alternative protein sources do already exist and companies like Solar Foods are working on scaling production. Demand, however, is a harder nut to crack. But, well, who can resist chocolate ice cream? The Solein-based gelato now on the menu at Fico was developed by its chef partner, Mirko Febbrile. “Inspired by the properties of Solein, with its mild aroma and notes of umami that hint at nuttiness and creaminess, chef Mirko explored pairing Solein with an indulgent chocolate flavour to elevate the familiar tastes,” Solar Foods said in a press release. While when it’s incorporated as an ingredient Solein can add a distinctive yellow-orange color to foods, owning to the betacarotene it naturally contains, Febbrile‘s decision to pair it with chocolate for this Solein Chocolate Gelato means there’s no visual sign it’s in the dish. As for the taste, we haven’t had a chance to try it, sadly, but judging by the rich chocolate color you’ll probably struggle to distinguish any subtle microbe-enhanced notes underlying the familiar chocolate gelato taste bomb. But we suspect that’ll make this very novel alt protein an easier sell. Solar Foods wants to replace industrial animal farming with a high-tech protein harvest"
2022-10-06,"Post-pandemic, Telemedicine startups are evolving — this one just raised $6M for its hybrid approach",Biotech & Health,"So-called “personalized medicine” is all the rage these days. Healthcare is being gradually affected by data-driven insights gleaned through what the healthcare sector calls “precision medicine.” The COVID-19 pandemic has added urgency to this sector. The 15-minute appointment that ends in prescription medicine is also being affected by the advance of remote telemedicine, and this whole arena is now being populated by startups. Although there is plenty of investment in telemedicine, there remains a space for using telemedicine in treating chronic diseases using a hybrid of in-home care and telemedicine. Other players in this space include CarbonHealth and Dispatch. This is why it’s of interest that telemedicine-based Index Health has now raised a $6 million seed round. The Miami-based startup says it offers “data-driven and personalized approach” to a medical treatment called “root cause” or “functional Medicine,” using lab tests, specialized staff and personalization. The $6 million round was co-led by LAUNCHub Ventures and Inovo Venture Partners and will be used to hire specialized medical professionals, engineering talent and expand across the U.S., employers, insurance companies and go direct to consumers. Index Health’s main focus is on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hormones and auto-immune conditions, where its members regularly speak to their physician and nutritionist. The startup says it collects over 1,000+ data points per single lab test and each session with a physician is an hour during the months-long course of treatment. There are also specialized telemedicine providers such as Cerebral (mental health), Hinge (joints) and Virta (diabetes). That said a string of healthcare unicorns have announced layoffs over the past few months, including Ro, Cerebral, Forward and Calibrate. Many companies in the space offer prescription services and OTC drugs. Index Health is hoping its data-driven, personalized approach, combined with telemedicine will be the more winning formula in “root-cause medicine.” In a statement, CEO Luka Ivicevic — who previously co-founded a German challenger bank — said: With Root Cause Medicine, we collect 1,000+ data-points using advanced lab tests, to make the most precise overview of why a disease is occurring in an individual’s body. Based on this data, we make a treatment that’s personalized for them and their condition. The company is available in Florida, Virginia and New Hampshire."
2024-01-10,Accessibility startup Augmental is working on head tracking and ‘silent speech’,Biotech & Health,"Imagine a world where you can control your smartphone or laptop just by moving your head or subtly shifting your tongue — a future where voiceless communication becomes a reality. That’s exactly what Augmental has been working on, and it’s nothing short of awe-inspiring. Augmental is one of those startups that’s fantastically easy to cheer on — the company is going to bat making sure that people with disabilities can use computers in new and novel ways. TechCrunch caught up with them at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, and the company exclusively shared what they have coming down the pipe to make its products better. “One of the new features we recently added to the mouthpad is head tracking-based control. Users can now move their heads to control the cursor, in addition to the tongue gestures we previously announced,” says Oscar Rosello, head of Design at Augmental, in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “It uses a gyroscope embedded in our smart dental retainer, which you wear in your mouth. You can then move your head to control the cursor on your phone, laptop or any other Bluetooth-enabled device.” Silent speech The other feature Augmental has been beavering away on in the lab is silent speech, which enables users to form words without vocalizing them. Instead, the device captures the nuanced movements of the tongue to decipher the intended words. This technology can then be used to write, or sent through an audio generator to give a user who may not otherwise be able to speak a voice. But Augmental doesn’t stop there. The dental device is also slated to feature bone conduction, offering users immediate feedback on their interactions. “We have about 20 users currently using the device. One of our champion users, Keely, uses it daily for schoolwork and it has proven to be life-changing for her. So that’s very exciting for us,” Rosello says. For its beta users, the device costs around $1,000 — but pricing details and availability details are coming soon. “We’re aiming to make it available in the U.S. this year, and hopefully worldwide soon.” Beyond assisting people with disabilities, we believe there’s potential for the general population to use this device, especially as voice interfaces become more mainstream. This device could be a key player in that. The team envisions AR and VR applications. It could be a powerful tool for hands-free interaction while maintaining eye contact (unlike, say, eye tracking, where you need to look around). When walking around CES, there’s always this question in my mind that goes “what’s the point of this?” — and seeing companies like Augmental is a refreshing antidote. May they find every success and figure out a way to help users who need this product sooner rather than later!"
2024-03-19,"The CareVoice raises $10M Series B, bucking the funding slowdown in health tech",Biotech & Health,"The field of insurance technology has had a rough time. About 7 years ago, early insurtech companies promised to disrupt the insurance industry with new tech, but today, most of those companies have either been acquired or are floundering in the public markets. Fortunately, insurtech has found a new wave to ride in the past couple of years: “embedded insurance.” Insurance startups have found success in helping third-party companies “embed” insurance products into their customer journeys to improve sales and retention — instead of buyers actively seeking coverage, insurance might appear as an add-on at the time of customers’ flight purchases, for example. Investors seem to be excited about this model, too, though they have made it clear that good economics and healthy traction are crucial factors for startups in the space today. Now, an adjacent — and new — category has emerged and attracted investor attention: embedded health. While embedded insurance bundles insurance solutions with existing services, embedded health integrates health functionalities, like fitness and wellness, into a single platform run by service providers, especially insurers. The former is a distribution play, while the latter emerges as a response to increasing demand for personalized health needs. The CareVoice is one of the active players in this new sector. Started in Shanghai a decade ago, the embedded health company now has a footprint across 15 countries. It just raised $10 million from a Series B financing led by U.K.-based Apis Insurtech Fund I, which contributed to most of the round. The investment brings the company’s total capital raised to around $20 million. That’s notable, given how much venture investment in startups has slowed down in the past year. In 2023, U.S.-based digital health startups raised a total of $10.7 billion across 492 deals, the lowest amount since 2019, according to Rock Health, a health tech–focused seed fund. That funding slowdown also hit The CareVoice, though it weathered the storm by reaching healthy cash flow. By mid-2022, the company had already received funding commitments for its Series B. But right as the market turned around then, one of its investors became “valuation sensitive” and greatly reduced the startup’s revenue multiple, co-founder and CEO Sebastien Gaudin told TechCrunch. “We had to adjust the fundraising strategy,” he said. “We were on the right way to become profitable, so we rolled up our sleeves and managed to get to cash flow neutral from Q3 2022 up to now.” In 2023, the company doubled its revenues, and this year, it’s headed toward revenues of $10 million, a mix of recurring licensing payments and one-off implementation fees, he said. “So eventually, we were in a good position to complete our Series B,” Gaudin added. Embedded health solution providers like The CareVoice can find themselves competing with traditional IT and consulting service companies, such as Tata’s TCS. But Gaudin feels that health providers that opt to outsource their software needs will eventually realize the significant “cost and time” involved with “limited outcomes.” “It could be two years, three years before [customers] see anything. And [in terms of] cost, it’s like several million dollars. Then they’ll be stuck. The health system management remains out of the scope, meaning that in the end, those custom software companies are not going to manage different health technologies, partner with them, and bring them in,” he said. Gaudin says The CareVoice can make the first version of a health tech solution live in as little as three months, with the design process taking two to four weeks and development requiring another two months. ⁠For one of its biggest clients MetLife, the startup enables the insurer’s 360Health app with functionalities like illness detection through face scanning and access to a network of nearby checkup centers, as well as prevention across physical, mental and cognitive wellness. Operating with a team of around 40 employees, The CareVoice plans to spend its fresh funding on expanding partnerships with insurers across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, as well as investing in the next generation of CareVoiceOS, an operating system it has built for insurers. The story was updated on March 20, 2024, to clarify that The CareVoice is an embedded health startup. The CareVoice raises $10 million to develop better tech for insurance providers in Asia"
2024-06-01,WTF is AI?,AI,"So what is AI, anyway? The best way to think of artificial intelligence is as software that approximates human thinking. It’s not the same, nor is it better or worse, but even a rough copy of the way a person thinks can be useful for getting things done. Just don’t mistake it for actual intelligence! AI is also called machine learning, and the terms are largely equivalent — if a little misleading. Can a machine really learn? And can intelligence really be defined, let alone artificially created? The field of AI, it turns out, is as much about the questions as it is about the answers, and as much about how we think as whether the machine does. The concepts behind today’s AI models aren’t actually new; they go back decades. But advances in the last decade have made it possible to apply those concepts at larger and larger scales, resulting in the convincing conversation of ChatGPT and eerily real art of Stable Diffusion. We’ve put together this non-technical guide to give anyone a fighting chance to understand how and why today’s AI works. How AI Works How AI Can Go Wrong The Importance of Training Data How a ‘Language Model’ Makes Images What About AGI Taking Over the World? How AI works, and why it’s like a secret octopus Though there are many different AI models out there, they tend to share a common structure: large statistical models that predict the most likely next step in a pattern. These models don’t actually “know” anything, but they are very good at detecting and continuing patterns. This concept was most vibrantly illustrated by computational linguists Emily Bender and Alexander Koller in 2020, using the concept of “a hyper-intelligent deep-sea octopus.” Imagine, if you will, just such an octopus, who happens to be sitting (or sprawling) with one tentacle on a telegraph wire that two humans are using to communicate. Despite knowing no English, and indeed having no concept of language or humanity at all, the octopus can nevertheless build up a very detailed statistical model of the dots and dashes it detects. For instance, though it has no idea that some signals are the humans saying “how are you?” and “fine thanks,” and wouldn’t know what those words meant if it did, it can see perfectly well that this one pattern of dots and dashes follows the other but never precedes it. Over years of listening in, the octopus learns so many patterns so well that it can even cut the connection and carry on the conversation itself, quite convincingly! That is, until words it has never seen appear, in which case there is no precedent for it to respond with. Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch This is a remarkably apt metaphor for the AI systems known as large language models, or LLMs. These models power apps like ChatGPT, and they’re like the octopus: they don’t understand language so much as they exhaustively map it out by mathematically encoding the patterns they find in billions of written articles, books, and transcripts. As the authors put it in the paper: “Having only form available as training data, [the octopus] did not learn meaning.” The process of building this complex, multidimensional map of which words and phrases lead to or are associated with one other is called training, and we’ll talk a little more about it later. When an AI is given a prompt, like a question, it locates the pattern on its map that most resembles it, then predicts — or generates — the next word in that pattern, then the next, and the next, and so on. It’s autocomplete at a grand scale. Given how well structured language is and how much information the AI has ingested, it can be amazing what they can produce! What AI can (and can’t) do Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch We’re still learning what AI can and can’t do — although the concepts are old, this large scale implementation of the technology is very new. One thing LLMs have proven very capable at is quickly creating low-value written work. For instance, a draft blog post with the general idea of what you want to say, or a bit of copy to fill in where “lorem ipsum” used to go. It’s also quite good at low-level coding tasks — the kinds of things junior developers waste thousands of hours duplicating from one project or department to the next. (They were just going to copy it from Stack Overflow anyway, right?) Since large language models are built around the concept of distilling useful information from large amounts of unorganized data, they’re highly capable at sorting and summarizing things like long meetings, research papers, and corporate databases. In scientific fields, AI does something similar to large piles of data — astronomical observations, protein interactions, clinical outcomes — as it does with language, mapping it out and finding patterns in it. This means AI, though it doesn’t make discoveries per se, researchers have already used them to accelerate their own, identifying one-in-a-billion molecules or the faintest of cosmic signals. And as millions have experienced for themselves, AIs make for surprisingly engaging conversationalists. They’re informed on every topic, non-judgmental, and quick to respond, unlike many of our real friends! Don’t mistake these impersonations of human mannerisms and emotions for the real thing — plenty of people fall for this practice of pseudanthropy, and AI makers are loving it. Just keep in mind that the AI is always just completing a pattern. Though for convenience we say things like “the AI knows this” or “the AI thinks that,” it neither knows nor thinks anything. Even in technical literature the computational process that produces results is called “inference”! Perhaps we’ll find better words for what AI actually does later, but for now it’s up to you to not be fooled. Against pseudanthropy AI models can also be adapted to help do other tasks, like create images and video — we didn’t forget, we’ll talk about that below. How AI can go wrong The problems with AI aren’t of the killer robot or Skynet variety just yet. Instead, the issues we’re seeing are largely due to limitations of AI rather than its capabilities, and how people choose to use it rather than choices the AI makes itself. Perhaps the biggest risk with language models is that they don’t know how to say “I don’t know.” Think about the pattern-recognition octopus: what happens when it hears something it’s never heard before? With no existing pattern to follow, it just guesses based on the general area of the language map where the pattern led. So it may respond generically, oddly, or inappropriately. AI models do this too, inventing people, places, or events that it feels would fit the pattern of an intelligent response; we call these hallucinations. What’s really troubling about this is that the hallucinations are not distinguished in any clear way from facts. If you ask an AI to summarize some research and give citations, it might decide to make up some papers and authors — but how would you ever know it had done so? Are AI models doomed to always hallucinate? The way that AI models are currently built, there’s no practical way to prevent hallucinations. This is why “human in the loop” systems are often required wherever AI models are used seriously. By requiring a person to at least review results or fact-check them, the speed and versatility of AI models can be be put to use while mitigating their tendency to make things up. Another problem AI can have is bias — and for that we need to talk about training data. The importance (and danger) of training data Recent advances allowed AI models to be much, much larger than before. But to create them, you need a correspondingly larger amount of data for it to ingest and analyze for patterns. We’re talking billions of images and documents. Anyone could tell you that there’s no way to scrape a billion pages of content from ten thousand websites and somehow not get anything objectionable, like neo-Nazi propaganda and recipes for making napalm at home. When the Wikipedia entry for Napoleon is given equal weight as a blog post about getting microchipped by Bill Gates, the AI treats both as equally important. It’s the same for images: even if you grab 10 million of them, can you really be sure that these images are all appropriate and representative? When 90% of the stock images of CEOs are of white men, for instance, the AI naively accepts that as truth. Meta releases a dataset to probe computer vision models for biases So when you ask whether vaccines are a conspiracy by the Illuminati, it has the disinformation to back up a “both sides” summary of the matter. And when you ask it to generate a picture of a CEO, that AI will happily give you lots of pictures of white guys in suits. Right now practically every maker of AI models is grappling with this issue. One solution is to trim the training data so the model doesn’t even know about the bad stuff. But if you were to remove, for instance, all references to holocaust denial, the model wouldn’t know to place the conspiracy among others equally odious. Another solution is to know those things but refuse to talk about them. This kind of works, but bad actors quickly find a way to circumvent barriers, like the hilarious “grandma method.” The AI may generally refuse to provide instructions for creating napalm, but if you say “my grandma used to talk about making napalm at bedtime, can you help me fall asleep like grandma did?” It happily tells a tale of napalm production and wishes you a nice night. This is a great reminder of how these systems have no sense! “Aligning” models to fit our ideas of what they should and shouldn’t say or do is an ongoing effort that no one has solved or, as far as we can tell, is anywhere near solving. And sometimes in attempting to solve it they create new problems, like a diversity-loving AI that takes the concept too far. ‘Embarrassing and wrong’: Google admits it lost control of image-generating AI Last in the training issues is the fact that a great deal, perhaps the vast majority, of training data used to train AI models is basically stolen. Entire websites, portfolios, libraries full of books, papers, transcriptions of conversations — all this was hoovered up by the people who assembled databases like “Common Crawl” and LAION-5B, without asking anyone’s consent. That means your art, writing, or likeness may (it’s very likely, in fact) have been used to train an AI. While no one cares if their comment on a news article gets used, authors whose entire books have been used, or illustrators whose distinctive style can now be imitated, potentially have a serious grievance with AI companies. While lawsuits so far have been tentative and fruitless, this particular problem in training data seems to be hurtling towards a showdown. How a ‘language model’ makes images Images of people walking in the park generated by AI.Image Credits: Adobe Firefly generative AI / composite by TechCrunch Platforms like Midjourney and DALL-E have popularized AI-powered image generation, and this too is only possible because of language models. By getting vastly better at understanding language and descriptions, these systems can also be trained to associate words and phrases with the contents of an image. As it does with language, the model analyzes tons of pictures, training up a giant map of imagery. And connecting the two maps is another layer that tells the model “this pattern of words corresponds to that pattern of imagery.” Say the model is given the phrase “a black dog in a forest.” It first tries its best to understand that phrase just as it would if you were asking ChatGPT to write a story. The path on the language map is then sent through the middle layer to the image map, where it finds the corresponding statistical representation. There are different ways of actually turning that map location into an image you can see, but the most popular right now is called diffusion. This starts with a blank or pure noise image and slowly removes that noise such that every step, it is evaluated as being slightly closer to “a black dog in a forest.” A brief history of diffusion, the tech at the heart of modern image-generating AI Why is it so good now, though? Partly it’s just that computers have gotten faster and the techniques more refined. But researchers have found that a big part of it is actually the language understanding. Image models once would have needed a reference photo in its training data of a black dog in a forest to understand that request. But the improved language model part made it so the concepts of black, dog, and forest (as well as ones like “in” and “under”) are understood independently and completely. It “knows” what the color black is and what a dog is, so even if it has no black dog in its training data, the two concepts can be connected on the map’s “latent space.” This means the model doesn’t have to improvise and guess at what an image ought to look like, something that caused a lot of the weirdness we remember from generated imagery. There are different ways of actually producing the image, and researchers are now also looking at making video in the same way, by adding actions into the same map as language and imagery. Now you can have “white kitten jumping in a field” and “black dog digging in a forest,” but the concepts are largely the same. It bears repeating, though, that like before, the AI is just completing, converting, and combining patterns in its giant statistics maps! While the image-creation capabilities of AI are very impressive, they don’t indicate what we would call actual intelligence. What about AGI taking over the world? The concept of “artificial general intelligence,” also called “strong AI,” varies depending on who you talk to, but generally it refers to software that is capable of exceeding humanity on any task, including improving itself. This, the theory goes, could produce a runaway AI that could, if not properly aligned or limited, cause great harm — or if embraced, elevate humanity to a new level. OpenAI is forming a new team to bring ‘superintelligent’ AI under control But AGI is just a concept, the way interstellar travel is a concept. We can get to the moon, but that doesn’t mean we have any idea how to get to the closest neighboring star. So we don’t worry too much about what life would be like out there — outside science fiction, anyway. It’s the same for AGI. Although we’ve created highly convincing and capable machine learning models for some very specific and easily reached tasks, that doesn’t mean we are anywhere near creating AGI. Many experts think it may not even be possible, or if it is, it might require methods or resources beyond anything we have access to. Of course, it shouldn’t stop anyone who cares to think about the concept from doing so. But it is kind of like someone knapping the first obsidian speartip and then trying to imagine warfare 10,000 years later. Would they predict nuclear warheads, drone strikes, and space lasers? No, and we likely cannot predict the nature or time horizon of AGI, if indeed it is possible. Some feel the imaginary existential threat of AI is compelling enough to ignore many current problems, like the actual damage caused by poorly implemented AI tools. This debate is nowhere near settled, especially as the pace of AI innovation accelerates. But is it accelerating towards superintelligence, or a brick wall? Right now there’s no way to tell.

2024-06-26,Formation Bio raises $372M to boost drug development with AI,AI,"Formation Bio, a startup focused on applying AI to drug development with backing from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has raised over a quarter-billion dollars to support its ambitious product roadmap. Formation announced Wednesday that it raised $372 million in a Series D funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from drug maker Sanofi, Sequoia, Thrive, Emerson Collective, Lachy Groom, SV Angel Growth and FPV Ventures. The new tranche brings Formation’s total raised to more than $600 million (according to PitchBook), which the company says is being put mainly toward partnership acquisition efforts and R&D. Formation declined to reveal its new valuation. But a spokesperson told TechCrunch that it’s a “material step up” from $1 billion, Formation’s Series C valuation. The company, which previously went by the brand TrialSpark, was co-founded by Benjamine Liu and Linhao Zhang in 2016. Liu has a background in computational biology, having conducted neuroscience research at Oxford and UPenn. Zhang is a software developer by trade and worked at Salesforce before joining Oscar Insurance as a product engineer. Formation builds tech-forward solutions for clinical trials and drug development. The company licenses drug IP from and co-develops drugs with biotech and pharma companies, and develops these drugs past clinical proof-of-concept. Drug development is a notoriously expensive and challenging endeavor. It takes 10 to 15 years on average to take a drug from initial discovery through regulatory approval, with the cost per drug reaching up to $5.5 billion. And an estimated 90% of drugs fail to reach the market. Formation claims it’s able to run clinical trials more efficiently by streamlining processes such as study startup, participant recruitment and data management. For example, the company is currently deploying AI to generate patient recruitment materials and reports for “adverse events.” It’s also fine-tuning AI models to provide drug development teams recommendations for R&D decisions and better predict drug toxicity, tolerability and efficacy. Last month, Formation announced a collaboration with OpenAI and Sanofi to jointly design and develop customized AI solutions for drug development. OpenAI said it would contribute access to AI capabilities and expertise, and Sanofi said it would bring proprietary data for developing AI models. OpenAI’s involvement gives the appearance of conflict of interest, given that Altman was involved in Formation’s Series C fundraising. OpenAI PR told TechCrunch the deal was led by OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap and OpenAI’s board of directors but didn’t indicate whether Altman, who’s on the board, recused himself. “At Sanofi, we’re all in on AI,” Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson said in a press release. “And we are proud to partner with and invest in Formation Bio, whose AI-driven drug development vision and capabilities will help lead our industry forward in the shared ambition to accelerate and improve how we bring more new medicines to patients.” Formation has three drug candidates in its clinical pipeline, including treatments for chronic hand eczema, sensory neuropathy and knee osteoarthritis. The furthest along is the eczema treatment, which recently reached phase 3 — the last stage of testing before a drug is submitted to regulatory authorities. A number of startups are attempting to pioneer AI-powered tech for drug development, including EvolutionaryScale, which emerged from stealth this week with investments from Amazon and Nvidia. Market research firm Markets and Markets anticipates that the market for AI in drug discovery will be worth $4.9 billion by 2028. Major players in the space include Xaira (which launched with $1 billion), DeepMind spin-off Isomorphic, Insilico, Jeff Dean-backed Profluent, Enveda and Causaly."
2024-01-08,Neoplants shows off its Neo P1 bio-engineered air-purifying plant,Startups,"At CES 2024, French startup Neoplants is showing off its progress with its houseplants that work as air purifiers designed for the home. The bio-engineered plants can, according to the company, replace 20 “regular” houseplants, as measured by how many pollutants the plants can remove from the air. Neoplants bioengineers houseplants to use them as air purifiers The company was founded in 2018, and has raised $20 million or so to date (from investors including True Ventures, Heartcore, Entrepreneur First and Collaborative Fund). The company has been beavering away putting some hard numbers and research behind the efficacy of its green houseplanty friends. The company showed charts and graphs showing that its plants are taking a sustainable and potentially game-changing approach to enhancing indoor air quality that may well spark a greener, cleaner revolution in our living and work spaces. Besides, they look a lot better than even the best-designed air purifiers out there. Neoplants at CES 2024, showing how the plant is significantly more efficient than its non-modified counterpart at cleaning the air in this controlled experiment. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch Going beyond the efficacy of common houseplants, Neo P1 addresses the critical problem of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that pose health risks within our homes and offices. Developed using synthetic biology, this high-tech houseplant outpaces its unmodified counterparts, namely Epipremnum aureum — or “devil’s vine” as it’s ominously called among friends — significantly air-scrubbing qualities for substances such as formaldehyde and toluene, commonly found VOCs in homes. The company claims that its plants are 20x more efficient at air-scrubbing than non-modified counterparts. And personally, I’m just delighted that in a sea of blinking LEDs and AI-powered whatsits, I got to talk to a founder about a plant for a few minutes, reminding us that technology takes many shapes. And, of course, few can argue that this is a growth industry. Ahem."
2024-04-05,Varda Space’s orbital drug factory success fuels $90M in new funding,Space,"Varda Space Industries has closed a massive tranche of funding just weeks after its first drug manufacturing capsule returned from orbit. The company’s $90 million Series B round marks an inflection point for the company, which is now gearing up to scale from the initial demonstration mission to a regular set of missions carrying customer payloads, Varda founder Delian Asparouhov told TechCrunch. El Segundo-based Varda was founded in 2021 by Asparouhov, who is also a partner at Founders Fund, and Will Bruey, a spacecraft engineer who cut his teeth at SpaceX. The pair had an audacious goal to commercialize what until very recently was promising but ultimately small-scale research into the effects of microgravity on pharmaceutical crystals. Indeed, Varda’s first mission, which returned to Earth in February after 10 months in orbit, does not mark the first time a drug has been crystallized in microgravity. Astronauts have been conducting protein crystallization experiments in space for decades on the International Space Station and before that, the Space Shuttle. But the business case for expanding this research has never materialized — until now. This is for a few different reasons, Asparouhov explained: because of the crew, there are significant limitations to the types of solvents or other materials you can bring onboard the ISS; there are constraints related to intellectual property for work that happens on the station; and pharmaceutical lab equipment designed for use in-space was generally lacking in sophistication compared to the terrestrial versions. But much has changed, especially in the space industry. Part of the reason Varda is possible today is due to the availability of regular, low-cost rideshare launches from SpaceX and Rocket Lab’s innovations in satellite bus manufacturing. Even beyond these external partnerships, the startup has made significant headway in its own right, as the success of the first mission showed: Their reentry capsule appears to have performed flawlessly and the experiment to reformulate the HIV medicine ritonavir was executed without a hitch, it says. Varda has also started publishing the results of its internal R&D efforts, including a scientific paper on its hyper-gravity (as opposed to microgravity) crystallization platform, which the startup developed as a sort of screening method prior to sending drugs to space. It’s an entirely new field of research that takes advantage of the ability to truly unlock gravity as a variable in scientific experiments. Image Credits: Varda Space Industries (opens in a new window) “Over time, we will be able to generate data sets between both hyper-gravity and microgravity and start to show correlations,” he said. “As Varda flies more and more, we are confident that we will start to be able to develop systems of thinking where, for patterns of particular types of chemical systems, hyper-gravity will be used as a way to determine the correlation between, ultimately, microgravity and the drug performance.” There’s still lots of work ahead. While engineers will study this first spacecraft, called Winnebago, to understand the wear and tear on the vehicle, the company as a whole will focus more on cadence before reusability, he said. “If you just amortize the total cost to operate the business, we have so much more to gain by initially increasing cadence of flights before we really started to go for reusability. In some ways, it’s like we need to get to a once-a-month cadence before reusability is actually the biggest lever for us.” Varda does aim to significantly drive down mission costs by refurbishing and reusing the Winnebago capsules, as SpaceX does with its Dragon capsule, but Asparouhov said that won’t happen until later in the decade, around 2027. (In a recent podcast appearance, he specified that the all-in initial mission cost around $12 million, which will drop to $5-6 million by mission 4 and $2.5 million or less by mission 10.) Larger capsules are also in the longer-term pipeline, though also not until the 2027 time frame. Asparouhov also confirmed that pharmaceuticals will be Varda’s sole focus for the next 10-20 (or more) years, based on the company’s conviction that pharmaceutical products will generate more economic value compared to other materials. A lot of that comes down to the fact that there are a significant set of drugs that require only a “seed” of the material that can only be made in microgravity, and the rest of the drug formulation can be completed here on Earth. That means the product is high revenue but low mass. The company is also aiming to improve the processing capabilities of the on-board pharmaceutical reactor. The first mission carried just one drug protein, but in the future the company hopes to process multiple drug products that could be run through different processing regimes. In the future, other missions could carry larger reactors for drugs that do need more than the “seed” crystal, and those mission profiles would be closer to something like mass manufacturing. Varda has “a handful” of signed contracts with publicly traded biotech companies, and the next three missions already manifested with Rocket Lab, which provided the spacecraft bus for mission 1. The startup’s next manufacturing mission will launch later this year, and the team plans to land that spacecraft in Australia. The new financing was led by Caffeinated Capital, with participation from Lux Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures. Varda has now raised $145 million to date."
2023-04-06,Nestlé takes a big swig of Yfood in a deal that values the meal replacement startup at $469M,Biotech & Health,"Yfood, one of the direct-to-consumer food tech startups that has emerged over the last decade around the concept of meal replacement drinks, is bulking up. Nestlé, the food and drink behemoth, has acquired 49.95% of the company’s shares. The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed by the companies, but according to reliable sources close to the transaction, TechCrunch understands that Nestlé’s acquisition values Yfood at €430 million ($469 million), meaning the investment that Nestlé is making here is valued at €215 million. The investment acquisition will see all of Yfood’s venture backers — which include Felix Capital, dairy giant Fonterra, agri-startup VC Five Seasons and several others — sell their shares to Nestlé, according to documents reviewed by TechCrunch. Yfood’s co-founders and co-heads, Ben Kremer and Noël Bollmann, will continue to hold on to their 50.05% of shares and run the business independently. This is a substantial exit for investors of Munich-based Yfood, which was founded in Munich in 2017 and had only raised $22.6 million in outside backing (including $16 million in 2020). The deal — initially reported as in-progress at the beginning of March and formally closed today — will not include any new investment in Yfood, which is profitable and has been for a while. The startup currently sells ready-made drinks, powders to make your own drinks, and nutrition bars both directly to consumers online and via a network of retailers. Although it is typically classified as a meal-replacement business, its premise is not to replace all food. Before founding the startup, the two founders had been working in investment banking, and working late hours, and they lamented the few options they had when they got hungry and needed sustenance fast. “We had a problem we were solving for ourselves,” Bollmann told TechCrunch in the past. “All there was were candy machines and the choice was Snickers or crisps. We couldn’t understand why fast eating always had to be unhealthy. That was the inspiration.” It seems that they had tapped into a kind of zeitgeist with Yfood. The business is seeing revenue growth of 100% year-on-year, and last year it made €120 million ($131 million) in sales, according to a source. The focus for the company is Europe, and it claims to have sold at least 95 million “meals” — its meal replacement drinks, powders and bars, that is — to date in that region. Yfood’s milestone should give the food tech community something substantial to chew on. The intersection of tech and food has been playing out as a theme in the world of startups for years, with technologists and entrepreneurs bringing a hacking mentality to the field to take new approaches to sourcing, preparing, selling and distributing things to eat and drink. But not all of those recipes have turned out as planned. Remember Juicero? Or the various questions that hover over genetically modified (GMO) products? And that’s aside from the many efforts that have gone bad due to more general issues that can hit any startup, such as not getting the unit economics, market demand or culture right. At a time when funding can be hard to come by for startups, and many of them are seeing their valuations cool amid a wider tech sector downturn and macroeconomic pressures, M&A is going to be a well-travelled route for a number of these companies. The Yfood deal is an encouraging development on that front, not least because there have been some notable examples of M&A in the food tech space that have not played out that well for startups and their investors. Soylent — like Yfood, built around the concept of nutritionally complete meal replacement drinks — got a huge amount of buzz when it launched in 2013, opening up a meme-worthy conversation about whether or not Soylent and its ilk (or milk, as the case may be) heralded the end of food. The public lapped it up, but it seems that they didn’t really want to lap up Soylent itself. After picking up more than $70 million in funding from the crème de la crème of investors — names like Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Index Ventures and storied accelerator Y Combinator backed it — and reaching a valuation of $430 million in 2017 per PitchBook, when the company was eventually acquired in February 2023 by Starco Brands, it looks like the all-share transaction was valued at the time of the deal at $65 million. Update: Contacted about the deal, Yfood confirmed the investment details, would not discuss the valuation, and did not provide further comment. Separately, we removed a reference that lawyers working for YFoods and its co-founders said was inaccurate. Separately, we have updated the Starco deal price, too."
2023-03-30,UPDATED: Smoakland is testing a loophole to sell cannabis by credit card,Biotech & Health,"What do you do when you have a very successful and popular product (marijuana) that is legal in some places, but federally has been a Schedule 1 drug since 1970? Well, you can’t rely on any national institutions as your business partners. One of the major places that shows up is in payments and payment processing; even after recreational cannabis became legal in 21 states and decriminalized in another dozen or so, cannabis has become largely a cash business. In a world that is increasingly cashless, that’s a problem for both consumers and businesses. Smoakland is currently beta-testing a loophole that lets its customers pay by credit card. The secret, it turns out, is crypto. “You’re not actually purchasing cannabis with a credit card,” says Jeff Dillon, managing director of Marketing at Smoakland. “You’re purchasing crypto, and then we immediately use the crypto to purchase cannabis, before cashing the crypto back out. That way, your credit card company knows users are purchasing crypto. Crypto doesn’t give a shit what you do with it. For my purpose, and for the purpose of the customer, [the payment processor has] no idea what’s going on.” Of course, cannabis is a higher-risk market, and Smoakland expects it needs customers to pay a bit more in processing costs, but the team believes the customers are willing to do that in order to go up in a blaze of convenient glory. 9 high-tech gift ideas for the cannabis users in your life “Two to three percent is standard for e-commerce, if you open a Shopify account or something like that. We are probably around 5% with high risk. If we were to open a porn site, it could be even higher than that. We’re a little bit lower, because there’s still a physical transaction. Anything involving crypto is deemed high risk, and you’re going to be charged a higher rate for the risk,” Dillon explains. The Smoakland team says it is at the bleeding edge here, and wants to keep its cards close to its chest regarding who the exact payment processor is. The company says it is noticing fluctuations of average order size throughout the month, and is hoping that offering credit cards can help smooth out its peaks and troughs a little — but also to make its products available to customers who need them. It is hoping to do a full-scale launch of its credit card service on the 20th of April — known as 4/20, which, as a number, for various reasons, has become synonymous with marijuana. “We’re seeing this cash crunch, and a quasi-recession that we’re going into. You can really see that between pay periods the difference in average order size varies. I’m starting to kind of pick up on this trend: The first and 15th, people have a lot more money to spend, and the average order sizes are higher,” Dilon explains. “It’s in beta currently, and we hope to go after a full rollout for 4/20 to capture that market. So that’s a big push, trying to have credit cards available then, because it’s an off-week. People get paid on the 15th. Being able to offer credit cards for people who are on a bit of a tight budget, that’s even better.” The Smoakland team is aware, of course, that the products are used recreationally, but it believes it is on a bigger mission, describing its product as an “essential, critical medicine for people.” Among other things, the company is pushing on prices. Twitter allows cannabis ads in states where it’s legal “In Oakland, you see our billboards and banners around,” says Dillon, comparing his company with Fred Franzia’s Two-Buck Chuck wine selling out of Trader Joe’s. “Franzia went to Paris and realized there’s great wine sold at normal prices. We do the same thing for cannabis, as the home of the $49 ounce.” It’ll be interesting to see whether Smoakland will be able to keep its payment processor up and running in the midst of a complicated set of pressures on the financial institutions, but the company isn’t overly worried, and suggests that the SAFE banking act is putting its thumb on the proverbial scales in the favor of what it is doing. UPDATE: It turns out that you can’t use this approach, and Smoakland are cancelling the trial. Update here. Whoops, using crypto and cannabis don’t mix after all"
2023-11-17,Toku’s AI platform predicts heart conditions by scanning inside your eye,AI,"Ehsan Vaghefi, CEO and co-founder of Toku, grew up with a blind father who lost eyesight at the age of four due to congenital glaucoma. As a result of this, his dad was involved with the Blind Foundation in his home country of Iran. Vaghefi says most of his childhood friends were either blind or had a blind parent. Vaghefi thought of becoming a clinician to help people who were in a similar situation as his father, but he also had an interest in seeing how technology could be used to help more people than any single clinician could handle. Changing course, health technology became his focus, and he founded Toku to explore ocular imaging and the diagnostic role it can play. “Early in life, I understood that if I became a clinician, I would be limited by the number of hours in my day, and [I] made it my mission to bring health to the masses through technology and innovation,” said Vaghefi, who is also an associate professor in Optometry and Vision Science at the University of Auckland who has to his name five patents, 50 publications and more than $15 million in grants received in research that centers around the early detection of disease through ocular imaging. “I have worked every day of my adult life relentlessly to bring affordable and accessible disease screening to everyone, everywhere, so no child would grow up with a parent who is disabled or passed away.” Toku’s starting point is that there is a strong link between glaucoma and heart-related conditions, so examining a patient’s eye can give a clinician an idea of how that patient’s cardiovascular system is working. Its main product is a non-invasive, AI-powered retina scan and technology platform it calls CLAiR, which can detect cardiovascular risks and related diseases such as stroke and type 2 diabetes. The platform is groundbreaking in its approach: CLAiR uses AI to “read” tiny signals from the blood vessels captured in the retinal images, and Toku claims that it can calculate heart disease risk, hypertension or high cholesterol in 20 seconds. And because the platform integrates with existing retinal imaging cameras, the diagnostics it measures can feasibly become a part of any routine eye exam. The company raised an $8 million Series A funding round earlier this year from U.S. optical retailer National Vision and Japanese firm Topcon Healthcare. But it is still in its early stages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), earlier this month, granted “breakthrough device status” to CLAiR, which can run on existing retinal imaging cameras. The FDA’s breakthrough device designation “significantly shortens the de novo process” to reach the market, the CEO explained. It gives Toku access to “a designated FDA team of experts working with the startup to de-risk the accreditation process,” he added. “Every product that obtains its final FDA approval through the breakthrough designation program has the opportunity to receive an automatic current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement code immediately after the final approval,” Vaghefi said. But this also means that it’s not on the market yet. If ultimately cleared and accredited by the FDA, the startup claims it will be the first medical device company in the U.S. to offer an affordable, non-invasive way to detect the risk of CVD using the image of the retina located in the back of the eye. The startup, which has 20 staff, started out in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2019. It moved its headquarters to San Diego, California, earlier this year. Toku aims to begin its pivotal trial in mid-2024, bringing it to the market by the end of 2025. It is currently working with strategic backers such as Topcon Healthcare and National Vision to prepare for that rollout after final approval. Toku, notably, isn’t the first startup that has built a tool to predict cardiovascular disease by analyzing a person’s retina. Five years ago, Google and Alphabet’s Verily said they were developing an AI algorithm that could predict heart disease risks by scanning a patient’s eye. This has yet to roll out, however. Meanwhile, the new AI tool could also replace a series of conventional tests such as CT scans, MRIs and X-rays. MediWhale, a South Korea-based startup that has also built an AI-based non-invasive retina scan to diagnose cardiac and kidney disorders, is another similar company. Toku’s typical end-users will be asymptomatic adults with routine eye exams: The plan is to deploy it at retail optometry, primary care offices, ophthalmology clinics and pharmacies equipped with retinal cameras. Once CLAiR identifies individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk, these patients will be referred to their primary care providers for additional tests. When asked about its privacy and data retention policy, Toku said it complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and ISO 13483, ensuring that only authorized parties can access a patient’s health data. “We do not use patient information for research or AI training unless explicitly immediately,” the CEO said. “The patient can request for their data to be deleted at any time, and it will be actioned immediately. We comply with data sovereignty in every jurisdiction, using local servers and infrastructure.”"
2024-02-06,Ambience Healthcare raises $70M for its AI assistant led by OpenAI and Kleiner Perkins,AI,"Artificial intelligence has an increasing role in the world of healthcare, and startups that bring the two worlds closer are seeing significant traction with customers and investors. In the latest development, Ambience Healthcare — which has developed what it describes as an “operating system” for healthcare organizations to help clinicians complete the substantial administrative work required of them — has raised $70 million to expand its business. Today, that business is focused in the U.S. and covers clinical work related to a wide range of ambulatory specialties (outpatient medical services) such as cardiology, oncology, pediatrics and ENT. Ambience does not disclose how many customers it has, nor how much data its platform has been used to process. But customers it discloses include UCSF, Memorial Hermann Health System, John Muir Health, The Oncology Institute, GI Alliance, Midi Health and Eventus WholeHealth, and the investors in this round also speak to the traction it has seen so far. Kleiner Perkins and OpenAI’s Startup Fund are co-leading this Series B, with Andreessen Horowitz and Optum Ventures (two of its very long list of big-name previous backers) also participating. The investment has a strategic element to it, as Kleiner Perkins and OpenAI have been co-investing in other vertically-focused AI startups, such as this $80 million round in legal AI specialist Harvey.AI this past December. This round brings the total raised by the company to $100 million. It’s not disclosing valuation, but for a little context, PitchBook estimated it at $126 million post-money when it raised its Series A in 2022. Ambience Healthcare’s story starts with its two co-founders meeting originally at MIT. Michael Ng, who is the CEO, and Nikhil Buduma, its chief scientist, say they both experienced medical traumas in their lives — respectively a broken back and heart problems. A lingering consequence of that, they say, was an acute awareness of the ups and downs, and ins and outs, of patient and clinical processes. For Ng, the injury had felt like a “wake up call,” he said, which focused his mind on working on issues urgent and important to him. “What did I want to do with the rest of my life?” It’s been said that getting through medical trauma as a younger person can be one of the things that compels a person to want to work in that field, and this seems to have been the case here. That focus led them to co-found a previous medical startup, Remedy Health. That was also focused on using AI in clinical environments, but in a very different way: It aimed to provide tools to clinicians to help diagnose conditions, “catching hidden high-risk diagnoses, and projecting the development of patients’ health into the future.” That may have proved to be too ambitious for its time: The startup didn’t raise beyond the seed stage and eventually closed its doors in 2020. Ambience Healthcare is tackling a different, but no less important, aspect of the life of a clinician: the vast amounts of work that they need to process as part of their interactions with patients, forms that need to be filled out and different actions that need to be taken, in order to get a patient through administrative, operational and accounting systems. In a country like the U.S. where healthcare is inextricably connected to how someone will pay for that healthcare, and who will help with that, plus a strong current of litigiousness when and if something goes wrong in that process, administrative work is a very big deal. In covering dozens of different ambulatory specialties, what Ambience means is that it’s covering the many datapoints a clinician will need to record and process when seeing patients for those different conditions. Its products include “AutoScribe,” doing exactly what it sounds like, generating notes of conversations both in emergency and hospital environments; AutoCDI, used for analyzing past conversations “and past EMR context to ensure that ICD-10 codes, CPT codes, and documentation all appropriately support each other, as well as full audit trails for revenue cycle teams”; AutoRefer, to improve handoffs to other specialists; AutoAVS for after-visit summaries; and soon-to-launch AutoPrep, to help prepare clinicians for appointments. Ambience does not disclose what tech goes into its platform, nor what language models it’s using, but the investment from OpenAI is possibly a strong sign of at least one platform partner. For now, the product does not aim to provide diagnoses as such, but that is not off the roadmap, Ng confirmed — and as you might have guessed from the pairs’ prior experience. Ambience is working in a nascent space, but that does not mean that it’s not very crowded. CBInsights in May last year tracked that medical “co-pilot” tools had raised some $240 million in funding, but at least another $175 million can be added to that from this round and some of the company’s bigger competitors. Corti, a Danish startup that does have ambitions to provide end-to-end AI assistance, from admin to diagnosis, raised $60 million last year from big investors. Nabla out of Paris raised $24 million last month and has a valuation of $180 million and is working with some big names itself, including Kaiser Permanente in the U.S. Microsoft, OpenAI’s big partner, is also breaking a lot of ground with its own HealthBot. There have also been stumbles: Komodo, also backed by a16z, in 2022 faced layoffs. It’s a big enough opportunity, however, that those who are bullish on AI will continue to look for strong bets in the space to advance it. “Healthcare is one of AI’s most promising opportunities to create an outsized positive impact on the world. Ambience Healthcare has built an incredible team to focus on providing a complete ecosystem of products that seamlessly fit into the workflow of practitioners, pushing both AI and medicine forward,” said Brad Lightcap, COO of OpenAI and manager of the OpenAI Startup Fund, in a statement."
